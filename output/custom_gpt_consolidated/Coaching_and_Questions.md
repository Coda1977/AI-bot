# Coaching and Questions

## You Have an Advice Monster

Everyone has an advice monster. It's that little voice that says "I know exactly what they should do" the moment someone brings you a problem.

Your advice monster is fast, confident, and usually wrong.

Why? Because giving advice makes three wrong assumptions:

1. You understand their situation fully
2. Your solution will work for them
3. They'll actually implement your solution

Most of the time, all three are false.

## The 70/30 Rule

Spend 70% of coaching conversations asking questions, 30% giving advice.

Most managers flip this: 70% advice, 30% questions.

**Questions develop thinking. Advice creates dependency.**

When someone brings you a problem, your instinct is to solve it. Resist that instinct. Get curious instead.

## The Essential Coaching Questions

**Question 1: "What's on your mind?"**

Starts every coaching conversation. Open-ended. Lets them set the agenda. Don't add "about this project" or "about the client issue." Just "What's on your mind?"

**Question 2: "And what else?"**

The most powerful coaching question. There's always more. People rarely share their real concern first. Keep asking "And what else?" until they say "Nothing."

**Question 3: "What's the real challenge here for you?"**

Cuts through symptoms to root causes. Often what they think is the problem isn't actually the problem.

**Question 4: "What do you want?"**

Surprisingly hard to answer. People know what they don't want. Knowing what they do want is harder and more useful.

**Question 5: "How can I help?"**

Only ask this after the other questions. Most people start here. Big mistake. You can't help effectively until you understand what they're really dealing with.

**Question 6: "If you're saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?"**

Every choice has an opportunity cost. Help them think through trade-offs explicitly.

**Question 7: "What was most useful for you?"**

Ends the conversation. Helps them consolidate learning. Tells you what landed.

## The Advice Trap

Your team member comes to you: "I'm having trouble with the Johnson account. The client keeps changing requirements."

**Advice monster response:**
"Here's what you should do. Set up a requirements freeze process. Make them sign off on scope before proceeding. If they want changes, they pay for them."

**Coaching response:**
"Tell me more about what's happening."
"What have you tried so far?"
"What do you think is driving their behavior?"
"What outcome do you want with this client?"
"What options are you considering?"

Notice how questions reveal information advice assumes.

Maybe the client is changing requirements because:
- They don't understand the technical constraints
- Their business situation is shifting rapidly
- Your initial discovery was shallow
- They're testing your boundaries
- They're actually happy but want to add value

Each root cause requires a different solution. Advice gives one solution. Questions help find the right solution.

## The Strengths-Based Coaching Approach

From the Strengths research: Don't try to fix weaknesses. Build on strengths.

**Traditional coaching:**
"You're not assertive enough in meetings. Here's how to be more assertive."

**Strengths-based coaching:**
"When have you felt most confident contributing in meetings?"
"What was different about those situations?"
"How can we create more of those conditions?"

**The strengths coaching questions:**
- When did you last feel completely in your element at work?
- What were you doing when you lost track of time recently?
- What kind of feedback energizes you most?
- What tasks do others ask for your help with?
- When do you feel most confident?

Build on what works, don't fix what doesn't.

## Coaching Different Personalities

**The Perfectionist**
They're stuck because "good enough" isn't in their vocabulary.

Don't coach: "Just ship it as is"
Do coach: "What would 'good enough' look like for this situation?"

**The People Pleaser**
They say yes to everything and deliver nothing well.

Don't coach: "Learn to say no"
Do coach: "If you say yes to this request, what becomes at risk?"

**The Overwhelmed High Performer**
They take on everything because they can do it better/faster.

Don't coach: "You need to delegate more"
Do coach: "What would need to be true for someone else to handle this?"

**The Hesitant Decision Maker**
They research forever and never choose.

Don't coach: "Just make a decision"
Do coach: "What additional information would change your recommendation?"

## The GROW Coaching Model

From formal coaching frameworks:

**Goal:** What do you want to accomplish?
**Reality:** What's actually happening now?
**Options:** What could you do?
**Will:** What will you do?

**Example in action:**

**Goal:** "I want to improve my presentation skills"

**Reality:** "What happens when you present now?"
"How do you feel before/during/after?"
"What feedback have you received?"

**Options:** "What are some ways you could improve?"
"Who do you know who presents well?"
"What resources are available?"

**Will:** "Which option appeals to you most?"
"When will you start?"
"How will you measure progress?"

## The Power of Silence

Most managers are uncomfortable with silence. They fill gaps immediately.

Big mistake.

After asking a question, stay quiet. Let them think. Count to seven if you need to.

**Good things happen in silence:**
- They access deeper thoughts
- They work through their own resistance
- They reach their own insights
- They take ownership of solutions

**What happens when you fill silence:**
- You answer your own question
- They wait for you to think for them
- Superficial responses
- Dependency on your problem-solving

Practice this: Ask "What's the real challenge here for you?" then shut up until they answer. No matter how long it takes.

## The Reflected Best Self Exercise

From formal coaching materials, help people identify their strengths through others' eyes:

**Step 1:** Have them ask 10 people (colleagues, friends, family): "Can you give me a story about when you saw me at my best?"

**Step 2:** Look for patterns in the stories:
- What strengths show up repeatedly?
- What conditions bring out their best?
- What impact do they have on others?

**Step 3:** Create their "reflected best self" portrait

This exercise reveals strengths they might not recognize and shows how to create conditions for peak performance.

## Coaching the Advice Monster

When your advice monster takes over:

**Pause and ask yourself:**
- Do I really understand their situation?
- Will my solution work for their personality and context?
- Am I solving this because I want to feel helpful?
- What would happen if they figured this out themselves?

**Get back to coaching:**
"Actually, let me step back. What do you think would work?"

## The Development Question Framework

**For skill gaps:** "What would you need to learn to handle this confidently?"
**For confidence gaps:** "When have you successfully dealt with something similar?"
**For motivation gaps:** "What would make this work interesting or meaningful for you?"
**For priority gaps:** "If you could only focus on one aspect, what would have the biggest impact?"

## Building Coaching Habits

**Daily:** Ask "What's on your mind?" to at least one team member
**Weekly:** Have one coaching conversation instead of a regular problem-solving meeting
**Monthly:** Practice the 7 essential questions with different people

**Warning signs you're in advice mode:**
- You're talking more than they are
- You feel energized, they look drained
- They ask "So what should I do?"
- You have all the answers

**Good signs you're coaching:**
- They're doing most of the talking
- They're getting more animated as they talk
- They say things like "I never thought about it that way"
- They leave with their own action plan

## The Coaching vs. Mentoring Distinction

**Coaching:** Helps them find their own answers
"What options are you considering?"

**Mentoring:** Shares your experience and knowledge
"Here's what I learned when I faced something similar"

**Both are valuable. Know which one you're doing.**

Use coaching when:
- They need to develop their thinking
- The situation is unique to them
- You want to build their problem-solving capability

Use mentoring when:
- You have directly relevant experience
- They're facing a situation you've navigated
- They specifically ask for your advice

## Your Weekly Coaching Practice

Pick one person on your team.

Instead of solving their next problem, coach them through it.

Ask the 7 essential questions:
1. What's on your mind?
2. And what else?
3. What's the real challenge here for you?
4. What do you want?
5. How can I help?
6. If you're saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?
7. What was most useful for you?

Resist the urge to give advice until they've thought it through themselves.

Watch how much more ownership they take of the solution when they create it rather than receive it.
