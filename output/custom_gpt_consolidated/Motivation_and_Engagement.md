# Motivation and Engagement

## Total Motivation Framework

There are six motivators that drive human performance. Three increase performance, three decrease it.

**Performance Increasing:**
1. **Play** - The motive experienced when the work itself is enjoyable
2. **Purpose** - The motive experienced when you value the outcome of the work
3. **Potential** - The motive experienced when the work enhances your identity

**Performance Decreasing:**
1. **Emotional Pressure** - The motive that relies on fear, peer pressure, or shame
2. **Economic Pressure** - The motive that relies on external rewards like money or status
3. **Inertia** - The motive experienced when you work simply because it's what you did yesterday

**The key insight:** Most organizations focus on pressure and rewards (the decreasing motivators) instead of play, purpose, and potential (the increasing motivators).

## Play: When Work Feels Like Fun

Play motivation happens when someone enjoys the actual work they're doing.

**Signs of Play motivation:**
- They lose track of time while working
- They voluntarily take on similar tasks
- They talk enthusiastically about the work process
- They experiment and innovate naturally

**How to increase Play:**
- Match tasks to strengths and interests
- Provide autonomy in how work gets done
- Encourage experimentation and creativity
- Remove unnecessary bureaucracy and obstacles

**Play killers:**
- Micromanagement
- Rigid processes for creative work
- No variety or choice in tasks
- Punishment for trying new approaches

**The Play question:** "What kind of work makes you lose track of time?"

## Purpose: When Work Matters

Purpose motivation happens when someone values the outcome their work creates.

**Two types of Purpose:**
1. **Personal Purpose** - The work advances their own goals and values
2. **Greater Purpose** - The work benefits others or contributes to something meaningful

**Signs of Purpose motivation:**
- They connect their daily tasks to bigger outcomes
- They care about the quality of their work beyond requirements
- They think about the impact on customers or colleagues
- They feel disappointed when projects get cancelled

**How to increase Purpose:**
- Connect daily tasks to customer outcomes
- Share stories of how their work made a difference
- Involve them in setting team or project goals
- Show the chain of impact from their work to results

**Purpose killers:**
- Work that seems pointless or bureaucratic
- No visibility into how their work matters
- Conflicting priorities that waste effort
- Lack of connection to customer or end user

**The Purpose questions:**
"Who benefits from your work?"
"What would happen if your role didn't exist?"

## Potential: When Work Develops You

Potential motivation happens when the work helps them become who they want to be.

**Signs of Potential motivation:**
- They ask for feedback and coaching
- They volunteer for challenging assignments
- They invest their own time in learning
- They see setbacks as learning opportunities

**How to increase Potential:**
- Provide stretch assignments that build new skills
- Give clear development feedback
- Create paths for advancement or specialization
- Connect current work to their career goals

**Potential killers:**
- Dead-end roles with no growth
- No feedback or development conversations
- Skills that won't transfer to future opportunities
- Lack of challenge or learning

**The Potential questions:**
"What skills do you want to develop?"
"How does this work help you become who you want to be?"

## The Pressure Trap

When Play, Purpose, and Potential are low, managers often increase pressure.

**Emotional Pressure tactics:**
- "Everyone is counting on you"
- "I'm disappointed in your performance"
- "The team is depending on this"
- Fear-based motivation

**Economic Pressure tactics:**
- "Do this for a bonus"
- "Your promotion depends on this"
- "Hit this number or else"
- Carrot-and-stick approaches

**Why pressure backfires:**
- Creates compliance, not engagement
- Increases stress and burnout
- Reduces creativity and problem-solving
- Makes people focus on avoiding punishment rather than achieving excellence

**The pressure question:** "Are you motivating through fear or opportunity?"

## Job Crafting: Letting People Reshape Their Work

From job crafting research, people are motivated when they can actively shape their work.

**Three types of job crafting:**

**Task Crafting:** Changing what they do
- Adding tasks that use their strengths
- Removing or minimizing tasks that drain them
- Changing how they approach routine tasks

**Relational Crafting:** Changing who they interact with
- Building relationships that energize them
- Minimizing interactions that drain them
- Creating mentoring or teaching opportunities

**Cognitive Crafting:** Changing how they think about their work
- Connecting their work to personal values
- Seeing their role as part of a larger mission
- Focusing on the aspects of their work they find meaningful

**How to enable job crafting:**
- Ask what parts of their job energize them most
- Look for opportunities to do more of what they enjoy
- Help them connect their work to their personal goals
- Give them autonomy in how they approach their responsibilities

## The Stay Interview

Instead of waiting for exit interviews, conduct stay interviews to understand what keeps people engaged.

**Key stay interview questions:**

**What do you look forward to when you come to work?**
Reveals their Play motivators

**What are you learning here that you couldn't learn somewhere else?**
Reveals their Potential motivators

**What would make you consider leaving?**
Reveals demotivation risks

**What can I do more of or less of as your manager?**
Reveals relationship factors

**What would make your job more satisfying?**
Reveals opportunities for improvement

**Conduct stay interviews:**
- Every 6 months with each team member
- After major project completions
- When you notice engagement changes
- Before they start looking elsewhere

## Recognizing What Motivates Each Person

People are motivated by different things. Don't assume everyone wants the same rewards.

**Some people are motivated by:**
- Public recognition and praise
- New challenges and learning opportunities
- Autonomy and independence
- Connection and collaboration
- Advancement and career progression
- Mastery and expertise development
- Meaningful impact on others

**The motivation conversation:**
"What kind of recognition is most meaningful to you?"
"What would make this work more interesting?"
"What development opportunities would you value most?"

## Motivation Killers to Avoid

**Learned helplessness:** When people feel their efforts don't impact outcomes
**Lack of progress:** When people can't see forward movement
**Conflicting priorities:** When people get pulled in multiple directions
**Unfair treatment:** When people see inconsistent application of rules
**Poor relationships:** When people don't trust or like their colleagues
**Unclear expectations:** When people don't know what success looks like
**Lack of resources:** When people can't do their job effectively

## Building Intrinsic Motivation

**Autonomy:** People need to feel they have choice and control
- Let them decide how to approach their work
- Give them authority to make decisions
- Avoid micromanaging

**Mastery:** People need to feel they're getting better at something that matters
- Provide challenges that stretch their skills
- Give feedback that helps them improve
- Create opportunities to develop expertise

**Purpose:** People need to understand why their work matters
- Connect their work to customer outcomes
- Share the impact they're having
- Involve them in goal-setting

## Your Motivation Audit

**For each team member, assess:**

**Play motivation (1-10):** How much do they enjoy the actual work?
**Purpose motivation (1-10):** How much do they value the outcomes?
**Potential motivation (1-10):** How much does the work develop them?

**Total motivation score:** Add all three scores

**If someone scores below 21:**
- Which motivator is lowest?
- What's one change you could make to increase that motivator?
- How can you reduce any pressure motivators?

**Monthly team motivation review:**
- Who seems most engaged and why?
- Who seems least engaged and why?
- What patterns do you notice?
- What changes could improve team motivation?

Remember: You can't motivate anyone. You can only create conditions where they motivate themselves.
