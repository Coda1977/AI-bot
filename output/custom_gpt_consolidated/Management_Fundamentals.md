# Management Fundamentals

## Your Number 1 Role

Being a manager is as easy as riding a bike. Except the bike is on fire, you're on fire, everything is on fire, and you're in hell.

That manager having a bad day? They got one thing right.

Management isn't a promotion. It's a career change. The skills that made you great at your job? They're now mostly irrelevant. Your technical excellence, your ability to crush spreadsheets or write beautiful code—none of that matters if your team delivers mediocre results.

Here's your new reality: You are responsible for the work of your direct team.

Not responsible for doing the work. Responsible for the work getting done, and done well.

Some new managers try to hack this by taking on all the important work themselves. They become the hero developer who codes all night. The hero marketer who writes every campaign. The hero salesperson who closes every deal.

It's understandable. It's also unsustainable. And it's not management—it's just doing your old job with a fancier title and more meetings.

Your actual job breaks down into two parts:

1. Make the work productive: Create goals that matter. Rebuild broken processes. Invent tools that multiply output. This is the "hard" stuff everyone thinks management is about.

2. Make the worker achieving: Give clear direction. Coach through problems. Build relationships that create trust. Deliver feedback that actually changes behavior. This is the "soft" stuff that's actually harder.

If someone on your team is mediocre, you did a mediocre job helping them learn. If your team has a reputation for missing deadlines, you have a reputation for missing deadlines. If they fail, you fail.

The whole game is getting work done through other people, not over them or under them.

## Author vs. Editor: Your Core Framework

In every conversation between a manager and an employee, someone sits in the Author seat and someone sits in the Editor seat.

Both seats must be filled. The question is: which one are you sitting in?

**The Two Seats**

The Author does the actual work. They take ownership, show initiative, display critical thinking, and create solutions. They Author.

The Editor doesn't do the work. They set expectations for what they're looking for, and when the Author presents their work, the Editor makes it better. They Edit.

Here's how to spot the difference:

Your struggling employees want YOU in the Author seat. They come to you saying, "There's a problem, what should I do?"

They want you to Author the solution so when things go wrong, they can say, "I just did what you told me."

Your best employees? They Author.

They come saying, "Here's the problem, here are three options I'm considering, and here's my recommendation."

**The Trap**

As a manager, if you're not requiring your direct reports to bring something for you to Edit, you're Authoring their work. You're not helping them improve their ability to think independently.

Every time you solve their problem instead of helping them solve it, you create dependency. They get weaker. You get busier. Everyone loses.

Think about it: When someone brings you a problem and you immediately start solving it, who's doing the thinking? Who's learning? Who's growing?

Not them.

**How to Stay in Editor Mode**

Never accept an empty page.

Employee: "We have a problem with the Johnson account."

You (Author mode): "Here's what we should do..."

You (Editor mode): "What are your thoughts on how to handle it?"

Edit, don't rewrite.

Even if their solution is 60% right, work with that 60%. Help them see what's missing. Ask questions that reveal gaps. Don't throw away their work and start over.

Make them defend their thinking.

"What other options did you consider?"

"What are the risks of this approach?"

"How would you handle it if X happened?"

"Why did you rule out Y?"

These questions build their judgment, not just their execution.

**The Dependency Test**

Count how many times in your next team meeting you Author versus Edit.

If you're Authoring more than 20% of the time, you're training your team to bring you problems, not solutions. You're teaching them that thinking is your job, not theirs.

## Core Management Rules

From Manager Core training:

**Rule #1: Everything is your responsibility!**

Not "fault" - responsibility. When your team fails, when projects derail, when communication breaks down - you own the outcome. This isn't about blame, it's about ownership.

**Rule #2: Your job is to serve your team!**

Why do managers receive higher compensation? Because your job is to multiply the effectiveness of others. You exist to make your team more successful, not to collect status.

**Rule #3: You are now the editor, no longer the author**

This is the fundamental shift. Stop doing the work. Start making the work better.

## The Manager's Trap

Eyes Off, Hands On = Abandonment
Eyes On, Hands Off = Editor (This is where you want to be)
Eyes On, Hands On = Micro-manager
Eyes Off, Hands Off = Just plain terrible

**How much of your time are you in the "Author" seat?**

With whom do you need to move into the "Editor" seat?

It's amazing what people are capable of when they know what you aren't going to be doing for them.

**Communicate what you are going to stop doing**

Don't be a critic!

When you transition to Editor mode, tell your team: "I'm going to stop creating the solutions and start helping you improve yours. Bring me your thinking, not just your problems."

## Essential Manager Questions

**The Precision Conversation Questions**

When delegating or setting expectations, use these four questions:

1. What precisely is at stake for customers, or employees?
2. What senior purpose is being served, and what makes it important now?
3. Why choose this person to do this task? What is it about their skills, position, and leadership that explains your interest in their contribution?
4. How will you assess success? Precisely what needs to be delivered and when? What measures will you track?

**QBQ (Question Behind the Question)**

When problems arise, instead of asking blame-focused questions, ask ownership-focused ones:

Instead of: "When will they get our pricing right?"
Ask: "What information can I bring them that might help?"

Instead of: "Why is leadership disconnected?"
Ask: "How can I create a faster feedback loop with leadership?"

Instead of: "Why is sales not selling?"
Ask: "What can I do to help?"

**A poor sailor blames the wind**
A poor teacher blames the students
A poor parent blames the kid
A poor manager blames the team
A poor salesperson blames the leads
A poor developer blames the requirements

## Your Weekly Self-Assessment

List your top 5 work activities from last week.

Circle the ones only you could have done. If you circled more than 2, you're still doing your old job.

Pick one task to delegate this week.

Ask yourself:
- In a given week, how many hours are you working?
- How often do you hear "what do you want me to do about this?" (rarely, sometimes, often, all the time)
- If you would be promoted tomorrow, how many people on your team can replace you?
- If you would be promoted tomorrow with significantly more responsibilities, what would your life partner say?

These diagnostic questions reveal whether you're building a team or creating dependencies.

Remember: Your success as a manager isn't measured by how much you can do. It's measured by how much your team can do without you.
