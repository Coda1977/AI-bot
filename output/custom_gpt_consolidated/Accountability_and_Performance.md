# Accountability and Performance

## The Accountability Ladder

Every performance conversation has five potential levels. Know which one you're at.

**Level 1: Conversation**
"I've noticed the Johnson report was late three times this month. What's happening?"

Use when: First time something's off. Good people with good intentions.

**Level 2: Performance Support**
"We agreed on Friday deadlines. You've missed three. What support do you need to deliver on time consistently?"

Use when: Pattern emerging. They may lack skills or tools.

**Level 3: Performance Planning**
"This needs to change. Here's what success looks like, here's the timeline, here's how we'll measure it. Are you committed?"

Use when: Clear pattern. Other approaches haven't worked.

**Level 4: Performance Management**
"Your role requires reliable delivery. Missing deadlines affects the team and our clients. If this continues, we'll need to consider other options."

Use when: Previous conversations haven't created change.

**Level 5: Employment Discussion**
"This role isn't working. Let's discuss next steps."

Use when: They can't or won't do the job.

**The Common Mistake:** Jumping to Level 4 energy with Level 1 language.

You're angry (Level 4) but you say "Hey, just wondering if you could maybe try to get reports in on time?" (Level 1).

This confuses everyone.

Match your energy to your level. Be direct about which conversation you're having.

## What Is Accountability?

From the Manager Core materials, accountability is:

- **Willingness to accept ownership for actions**
- **Clear commitments that – in the eyes of others – have been kept**
- **Caring for the outcome and value of an activity, and not only for your part of the process**

**It's easy to deflect accountability:**

The meeting started late → Not my fault, I was on time
The project is behind → Waiting on legal approval
The client is upset → They changed their requirements
The sales target was missed → Marketing didn't deliver leads

Every excuse shifts responsibility away from the person making it.

## The Precision Conversation

When performance is off, use this exact framework:

**What precisely is at stake for customers, or employees?**

Not "we need better results." Specific: "The client is considering switching vendors because reports arrive Tuesday when they need them Monday for their board meetings."

**What senior purpose is being served, and what makes it important now?**

Connect to bigger goals: "We promised them decision-ready data. Without that, they can't serve their customers. That's our whole value proposition."

**Why choose this person to do this task?**

What about their skills, position, and leadership explains your interest in their contribution?

"You understand both the technical requirements and client needs. That combination is rare on our team."

**How will you assess success?**

Precisely what needs to be delivered and when? What measures will you track?

"Reports delivered by 5 PM Friday every week. Quality measured by number of client questions requiring clarification."

This conversation creates clarity where blame lives.

## The Question Behind the Question (QBQ)

When things go wrong, check the questions you're asking.

**Victim questions create excuses:**
"When will they get our pricing right?"
"Why is leadership disconnected?"
"Why is sales not selling?"

**Ownership questions create solutions:**
"What information can I bring them that might help?"
"How can I create a faster feedback loop with leadership?"
"What can I do to help?"

**A good QBQ:**
- Starts with "What" or "How" (not "Why" or "When")
- Contains an "I" (not "they," "we," or "you")
- Focuses on action

Train your team to ask better questions. When someone comes with "Why did they mess this up?" coach them to "What can I do to prevent this next time?"

## The Five Accountabilities Framework

From Managing Yourself materials, there are five core accountabilities every professional must own:

**1. Communication Accountability**
You are responsible for ensuring your message is understood, not just delivered.

**2. Learning Accountability**
You are responsible for developing the skills your role requires.

**3. Results Accountability**
You are responsible for the outcomes you commit to deliver.

**4. Relationship Accountability**
You are responsible for the quality of your working relationships.

**5. Growth Accountability**
You are responsible for your own development and improvement.

**Common deflections for each:**
1. "I told them" (but they didn't understand)
2. "Nobody taught me" (so you didn't learn)
3. "It wasn't my fault" (but it was your commitment)
4. "They're difficult to work with" (but you haven't tried different approaches)
5. "I need more feedback" (but you haven't sought it out)

## Personality Patterns in Performance Failure

From Managing Yourself research, people fail in predictable patterns based on personality:

**The Diligent Type** - Works hard but misses strategic priorities
*Fix:* Weekly priority alignment conversations

**The Bold Type** - Takes big swings but ignores important details
*Fix:* Structured check-ins on execution

**The Skeptical Type** - Questions everything, slows decision-making
*Fix:* Time-bound analysis phases

**The Cautious Type** - Avoids risk, misses opportunities
*Fix:* Small experiment frameworks

**The Leisurely Type** - Goes at their own pace, misses urgency
*Fix:* Deadline accountability structures

**The Colorful Type** - Chases new initiatives, abandons commitments
*Fix:* Commitment tracking systems

**The Imaginative Type** - Perfect is the enemy of done
*Fix:* Iteration deadlines

**Key insight:** Don't manage the behavior, manage the pattern. If someone's being bold, they need detail systems. If someone's being cautious, they need small bet opportunities.

## The Accountability Axis

From Manager Core, when problems arise, you can position yourself in four ways:

**Solving** - You take action to fix it
**Perpetuating** - You make it worse through your actions
**Observing** - You watch but don't engage
**Giving advice** - You offer suggestions but don't take action

The only position that changes outcomes is Solving.

If you're Giving advice repeatedly, you're not managing - you're consulting.

If you're Observing, you're not managing - you're monitoring.

If you're Perpetuating, you're part of the problem.

**The question:** For your current biggest team challenge, which position are you in?

## Creating Performance Agreements

Don't assume alignment. Create explicit agreements:

**What exactly will be delivered?**
"A weekly status report showing project progress, upcoming milestones, and blockers requiring help."

**When exactly will it be delivered?**
"Every Friday by 5 PM, starting this week."

**How will quality be measured?**
"Report should answer: Where are we versus plan? What's at risk? What help do you need?"

**What happens if the agreement isn't kept?**
"If you miss two reports, we'll move to daily check-ins until consistency is rebuilt."

Get them to restate the agreement: "Can you tell me what we just agreed to?"

This isn't micromanaging. It's clarity.

## The Poor Sailor Principle

"A poor sailor blames the wind"

Fill in the blanks:
- A poor teacher blames the ______
- A poor parent blames the ______
- A poor manager blames the ______
- A poor salesperson blames the ______
- A poor developer blames the ______

Every role has its "wind" - external factors that make the job harder. Weather, customers, requirements, budgets, timelines, resources.

Good performers work with the wind. Poor performers blame the wind.

**When someone on your team is blaming the wind, ask:**
"What's one thing you could control that might change the outcome?"

## Your Weekly Accountability Check

**Monday:** What did you commit to deliver this week?
**Wednesday:** Are you on track? What help do you need?
**Friday:** What did you deliver? What did you learn?

**For your team:**
- Who made clear commitments this week?
- Who delivered what they promised?
- Who needs support to stay accountable?
- What patterns do you see?

**For yourself:**
- What did you commit to your boss?
- What did you commit to your team?
- What did you commit to yourself?
- Which commitments are you keeping?

Accountability flows up, down, and sideways. Model it first.

## The Ownership Conversation

When someone deflects responsibility:

**Step 1: Acknowledge their perspective**
"I hear that legal approval was delayed."

**Step 2: Redirect to ownership**
"Given that reality, what could you have done differently?"

**Step 3: Focus forward**
"For next time, how can you maintain progress despite external delays?"

**Step 4: Get commitment**
"What will you do differently in a similar situation?"

Don't argue about whether their excuse is valid. Focus on what they can control.
