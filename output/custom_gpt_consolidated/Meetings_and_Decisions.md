# Meetings and Decisions

## The 10 Behaviors of Great Meetings

From your core materials, great meetings aren't about perfect agendas or fancy rooms. They're about behaviors that create productive conversations.

**The 10 Essential Behaviors:**

**1. Start on time, every time**
Waiting for latecomers punishes the people who showed up on time and teaches everyone that the start time is optional.

**2. State the purpose clearly**
"We're here to decide whether to launch the new feature" is better than "Let's discuss the new feature."

**3. Keep phones and laptops closed (unless needed for the meeting)**
Multitasking during meetings is like having a conversation while reading a book. Nobody gets your full attention.

**4. Invite only people who can contribute or need to hear the discussion**
More people doesn't mean better decisions. It usually means longer meetings with less clarity.

**5. End with clear actions and owners**
Every meeting should produce specific commitments: who will do what by when.

**6. Speak to be heard, not to be right**
The goal is understanding and progress, not winning arguments.

**7. Build on others' ideas before critiquing them**
"Yes, and..." creates more options than "No, but..."

**8. Ask questions that move thinking forward**
"What would need to be true for this to work?" is more useful than "Why won't this work?"

**9. Focus on decisions that need to be made, not information that could be shared**
Use email for updates. Use meetings for decisions.

**10. Protect quiet voices and manage dominant ones**
The best ideas often come from people who don't speak first or loudest.

## The Decision-Making Framework

Not every decision needs a meeting. Know which ones do.

**Type 1: Irreversible decisions** (one-way doors)
- High stakes
- Hard to undo
- Require deep analysis
- Need broad input
- Use meetings for thorough discussion

**Type 2: Reversible decisions** (two-way doors)
- Lower stakes
- Easy to change later
- Can be made quickly
- Don't need consensus
- Avoid meetings when possible

**The decision test:** "How hard would it be to change this decision later?"

If it's easy to change, decide quickly and adjust if needed. If it's hard to change, invest time in getting it right.

## Meeting Types and Their Purpose

**Status meetings:** Share information
- Keep them short (15-30 minutes)
- Use a standard format
- Focus on what others need to know
- Send pre-read when possible

**Problem-solving meetings:** Generate solutions
- Define the problem clearly first
- Set time limits for idea generation
- Focus on options before evaluation
- End with next steps

**Decision meetings:** Choose a path forward
- Present options with pros/cons
- Identify decision criteria
- Make the decision in the meeting
- Assign ownership for execution

**Planning meetings:** Coordinate work
- Define outcomes and timelines
- Identify dependencies
- Assign responsibilities
- Create accountability structures

**Innovation meetings:** Create new ideas
- Suspend judgment initially
- Build on wild ideas
- Focus on quantity first, quality later
- Capture everything

## The RAPID Decision Model

For important decisions, clarify who has what role:

**Recommend:** Who gathers information and proposes options?
**Agree:** Who must agree before the decision is made?
**Perform:** Who will execute the decision?
**Input:** Who provides input but doesn't decide?
**Decide:** Who makes the final decision?

**Common problems:**
- Too many people in "Decide" role
- No one clearly in "Recommend" role
- "Input" people think they're "Agree" people
- "Perform" people not included in discussion

## Running Effective Decision Meetings

**Before the meeting:**
- Send the decision that needs to be made
- Share options being considered
- Include relevant background information
- Specify who needs to decide vs. provide input

**During the meeting:**
- Restate the decision to be made
- Review options and criteria
- Hear input from relevant people
- Make the decision
- Confirm who owns next steps

**After the meeting:**
- Document the decision and reasoning
- Communicate to stakeholders
- Set up accountability for execution

## The Pyramid Principle for Meeting Communication

From the strategic communication materials, structure your communication in meetings using the pyramid principle:

**Start with the conclusion:** "I recommend we proceed with Option A"

**Provide three supporting points:**
1. "It addresses our biggest customer concern"
2. "We can implement it with existing resources"
3. "The risk is manageable"

**Then dive into details for each point**

This structure helps people follow your logic and makes decisions clearer.

## Managing Meeting Energy

**Energy killers:**
- Starting late or going long
- Rehashing previously made decisions
- Talking in circles without progress
- Letting one person dominate
- Getting stuck in technical details
- No clear next steps

**Energy creators:**
- Making visible progress
- Everyone contributing meaningfully
- Reaching clear decisions
- Solving real problems
- Learning something new
- Building on each other's ideas

## The Meeting Audit

**Monthly meeting review:**

**Which meetings energize your team?** (Do more of these)
**Which meetings drain your team?** (Fix or eliminate these)
**Which meetings could be emails?** (Stop having these)
**Which important conversations aren't happening?** (Schedule these)

**For each recurring meeting:**
- Is the purpose clear?
- Are the right people attending?
- Are we making progress?
- Could this be done more efficiently?

## Virtual Meeting Excellence

**Technical setup:**
- Good lighting and camera angle
- Quality microphone
- Stable internet connection
- Familiar with the platform

**Engagement practices:**
- Use chat for questions and reactions
- Call on people by name
- Use breakout rooms for small group discussions
- Share screens effectively
- Take breaks every 45-60 minutes

**Virtual meeting challenges:**
- Harder to read body language
- More distractions
- Screen fatigue
- Technology problems
- Difficult to build rapport

## Decision Documentation

**For important decisions, document:**
- What decision was made
- Who made it and when
- What options were considered
- Why this option was chosen
- What the next steps are
- How success will be measured

**Share decision documentation with:**
- People who will be affected
- People who provided input
- People who need to execute
- Future team members who join

## Your Meeting Effectiveness Assessment

**Rate your team's meetings (1-10) on:**
- Starting and ending on time
- Clear purpose and outcomes
- Right people attending
- Everyone contributing
- Making real progress
- Energizing vs. draining

**For improvement:**
- Which area scored lowest?
- What would make the biggest difference?
- What's one change you could make this week?
- How will you measure improvement?

Remember: Great meetings don't happen by accident. They result from intentional behaviors and clear structures that help groups think and decide together effectively.
