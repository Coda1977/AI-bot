# Strategic Communication

## The Pyramid Principle

From Barbara Minto's research, clear communication follows a pyramid structure: conclusion first, then supporting arguments, then details.

**Why this works:** The human mind can only process about 7 pieces of information at once. When you give people details first, they lose track of your main point.

**Traditional approach:**
"Last quarter we analyzed customer feedback, conducted market research, reviewed competitor pricing, evaluated our cost structure, and considered strategic options..."

**Pyramid approach:**
"I recommend we reduce our price by 15%. Here's why: customers say we're too expensive, competitors are undercutting us, and we can afford the margin hit."

**The difference:** The second approach tells you the conclusion immediately, then explains the reasoning.

## The SCQA Framework

For any important communication, use this structure:

**Situation:** What's the context?
**Complication:** What's the problem or opportunity?
**Question:** What question does this raise?
**Answer:** What's your recommendation?

**Example:**
**Situation:** "Our customer retention rate has been 85% for the past two years"
**Complication:** "This quarter it dropped to 78%"
**Question:** "What should we do to stop this decline?"
**Answer:** "We need to implement a proactive customer success program"

## Message Mapping

Before any important conversation, map out your message:

**Core message:** One sentence that captures your main point
**Supporting points:** 3-4 arguments that support your core message
**Evidence:** Data, examples, or stories that prove each supporting point

**Test your message map:**
- Can someone repeat your core message after hearing it once?
- Do your supporting points clearly connect to your core message?
- Is your evidence compelling and relevant?

## Storytelling for Impact

Facts tell, but stories sell. Use the story structure to make your communication memorable:

**Context:** Set the scene
**Character:** Who was involved?
**Conflict:** What challenge did they face?
**Resolution:** How did they solve it?
**Connection:** Why does this matter for your audience?

**Example:**
"Last month, our biggest client called me frustrated. They'd been waiting three days for a simple invoice correction. Our finance team was backlogged, and the client was considering switching vendors. We fixed their issue in two hours and created a dedicated fast-track process for urgent requests. Now we handle 90% of similar requests within four hours. This shows why we need to invest in customer service automation."

## Audience-Centered Communication

**Before any important communication, ask:**
- What does my audience care about most?
- What concerns or objections might they have?
- What level of detail do they need?
- What action do I want them to take?

**Different audiences need different approaches:**

**Executive audience:** Focus on business impact, high-level strategy, resource requirements
**Peer audience:** Focus on collaboration, mutual benefits, implementation details
**Team audience:** Focus on how it affects their work, what they need to do, support available

## The Clarity Test

**After preparing any important communication, test for clarity:**

**The elevator test:** Can you explain your main point in 30 seconds?
**The colleague test:** Can a colleague who wasn't involved understand and repeat your message?
**The action test:** Is it clear what you want people to do after hearing your message?

## Handling Questions and Objections

**When you don't know the answer:**
"That's a great question. I don't have that information with me, but I'll find out and get back to you by [specific time]."

**When you disagree with the premise:**
"I see it differently. Here's why..." (then explain your perspective with evidence)

**When you need to redirect:**
"That's important, and it's somewhat outside what we're discussing today. Can we address that separately?"

**When you're challenged aggressively:**
"Help me understand your concern" (then listen fully before responding)

## Written Communication Excellence

**For emails and documents:**

**Subject line clarity:** Your subject line should summarize your message
**Front-load important information:** Put your main point in the first sentence
**Use structure:** Bullet points, headers, and white space make content scannable
**End with action:** Be specific about what you need and when

**Email example:**
Subject: "Recommendation: Delay product launch by 2 weeks"

"I recommend we delay the product launch from March 15 to March 29. Here's why:

• Quality testing revealed two critical bugs that need fixing
• Marketing materials aren't ready due to design changes
• Delaying 2 weeks lets us launch properly rather than scramble

Next steps: I need your approval by Friday so we can communicate the new timeline to stakeholders.

## Meeting Communication

**When presenting in meetings:**
- State your purpose: "I'm here to get your decision on..."
- Give your recommendation first: "I recommend we..."
- Provide supporting evidence: "Here's why..."
- Ask for what you need: "What questions do you have?" or "Can I get your approval?"

**When facilitating discussions:**
- Ask open questions: "What options should we consider?"
- Summarize what you hear: "So you're saying..."
- Test for agreement: "Does everyone support this direction?"
- Clarify next steps: "Who will do what by when?"

## Difficult Conversations

**Structure for challenging discussions:**
1. **State your intention:** "I want to discuss something that's affecting our team's performance"
2. **Share your observation:** "I've noticed that deadlines are being missed regularly"
3. **Ask for their perspective:** "What's your view on this?"
4. **Listen fully** before responding
5. **Collaborate on solutions:** "What can we do to improve this?"
6. **Agree on next steps:** "Let's check progress again in two weeks"

## Visual Communication

**When using slides or documents:**
- One main point per slide
- Use visuals to support your message, not decorate it
- Keep text minimal and font large
- Use color and contrast to highlight important information
- Tell a story with your sequence of slides

## Your Communication Assessment

**Rate yourself (1-10) on:**
- Getting to the point quickly
- Organizing information logically
- Adapting to your audience
- Handling questions confidently
- Making complex ideas simple
- Inspiring action

**For improvement:**
- Which area needs the most work?
- What's one specific change you could make?
- Who could give you feedback on your communication?
- How will you practice these skills?

Remember: Great communication isn't about using fancy words or perfect grammar. It's about helping people understand your ideas and inspiring them to act.
