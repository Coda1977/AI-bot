# Delegation and Authority

## The Monkey Problem

There's a monkey on someone's back. The question is: whose?

Every conversation between a manager and employee is about moving monkeys. The goal is to keep the monkeys where they belong - on your employees' backs, not yours.

**How monkeys jump to your back:**

Employee: "We have a problem with the Johnson account."

You: "Let me think about it and get back to you."

Congratulations. The monkey just jumped from their back to yours. They feel better. You feel busier. The monkey got fed.

**How to keep monkeys where they belong:**

Employee: "We have a problem with the Johnson account."

You: "What's your assessment of the situation?"

Them: "Well, they're upset about the delivery timeline."

You: "What options are you considering?"

Them: "I could call them to discuss alternatives, or we could expedite shipping."

You: "What's your recommendation and why?"

Them: "I think we should call first. If we understand their real constraints, we might find a solution that doesn't cost us overtime."

You: "I agree. When will you make that call?"

Them: "I'll call this afternoon and update you tomorrow."

The monkey stayed on their back. They did the thinking. They made the plan. They own the outcome.

## The Author vs Editor Framework

In every delegation conversation, someone sits in the Author seat, someone sits in the Editor seat.

**Author responsibilities:**
- Research the problem
- Generate options
- Make recommendations
- Own the execution
- Report on outcomes

**Editor responsibilities:**
- Set clear expectations
- Provide resources and context
- Review proposals
- Give feedback
- Make final decisions (when necessary)

**The fundamental rule:** Don't accept an empty page.

If they bring you a problem without options, you're being asked to Author their work.

"Come back with three options and your recommendation" keeps them in the Author seat.

## Mandate Levels: How Much Authority to Give

From Manager Core training, different tasks require different levels of authority:

**Level 1: Research and Report**
"Look into the vendor options and present three alternatives with pros and cons."

Use when: High stakes, new employee, or they lack context.

**Level 2: Research and Recommend**
"Evaluate vendors and recommend which one we should choose, with your reasoning."

Use when: You trust their judgment but want to review major decisions.

**Level 3: Research, Recommend, and Act Unless I Say No**
"Pick a vendor and send me your choice. I'll object if I disagree. Otherwise, proceed."

Use when: You trust their judgment and want to maintain oversight without slowing things down.

**Level 4: Act and Inform**
"Choose a vendor and let me know what you decided."

Use when: High trust, lower stakes, or they have expertise you lack.

**Level 5: Act**
"Handle the vendor selection."

Use when: Complete trust and autonomy.

**Key insight:** Match the mandate level to the situation, not the person. A senior person gets Level 5 authority on routine decisions but Level 2 on strategic ones.

## The High Agency Delegation Method

High agency means giving people ownership over outcomes, not just tasks.

**Low agency delegation:**
"Call the client and tell them we'll have the report ready Tuesday."

**High agency delegation:**
"The client needs confidence that we'll deliver on time. Make that happen."

The first tells them what to do. The second tells them what to achieve and lets them figure out how.

**High agency thinking:**
- How can we solve this?
- What resources do I need?
- What would success look like?
- How can I exceed expectations?

**Low agency thinking:**
- What exactly should I do?
- Is this the right approach?
- Should I check with you first?
- What if something goes wrong?

Train people to think about outcomes, not just activities.

## Why Delegation Fails

**You don't define success clearly**
"Handle the client situation" means different things to different people.

Better: "Client needs to feel confident we'll deliver on time, understand any concerns they have, and agree on communication going forward."

**You delegate task, not outcome**
"Send the client an update" vs "Ensure the client feels informed and confident"

**You take it back at the first sign of struggle**
This trains them to struggle visibly so you'll rescue them.

**You delegate what you don't want to do**
This signals to your team that delegation is about dumping work, not developing people.

**You don't match authority to responsibility**
You hold them accountable for outcomes but don't give them authority to achieve those outcomes.

## The Delegation Conversation Framework

**Step 1: Context**
"Here's why this matters and how it connects to our bigger goals."

**Step 2: Outcome**
"Here's what success looks like when you're done."

**Step 3: Authority**
"Here's the level of authority you have and what decisions you can make independently."

**Step 4: Resources**
"Here are the resources available to you and the constraints you need to work within."

**Step 5: Check-ins**
"Here's when and how we'll check progress."

**Step 6: Confirmation**
"Tell me what you understand you're committing to deliver."

Don't skip Step 6. If they can't restate it clearly, you didn't delegate clearly.

## The "Zig-Zag" Delegation Trap

Zig-zag delegation happens when you keep changing your mind about what you want or taking parts of the work back.

Monday: "Handle the client presentation"
Wednesday: "Actually, let me review your slides first"
Friday: "You know what, I'll just do the presentation myself"

This teaches your team that you don't really trust them and they shouldn't invest too much effort in delegated work.

**Instead:** Stick to your delegation decision unless there's a genuine emergency.

Support them through problems. Coach them through mistakes. Don't rescue them from learning.

## What to Delegate First

**Delegate tasks that:**
- You do regularly but don't require unique expertise
- Would develop someone's skills
- Match someone's strengths or interests
- Free you up for higher-value work

**Don't delegate:**
- Personnel decisions
- Sensitive client relationships (until they're ready)
- Strategic planning
- Crisis situations (until they have experience)

**The 70% rule:** If someone can do it 70% as well as you can, delegate it. The remaining 30% isn't worth your time unless the stakes are exceptionally high.

## Building Delegation Muscles

**Week 1:** Pick one recurring task to delegate
**Week 2:** Delegate one decision that doesn't require your unique expertise
**Week 3:** Delegate a small project with clear outcomes
**Week 4:** Delegate something you actually enjoy doing (this is the hardest)

**The delegation test:** If you're working more than 50 hours per week regularly, you're not delegating enough.

## The Editor's Toolkit

When someone brings you work to edit:

**Ask, don't tell:**
"What other options did you consider?"
"What would happen if we tried X?"
"How did you think about the trade-offs?"

**Improve, don't redo:**
Even if their solution is only 60% right, work with that 60%. Help them see what's missing rather than starting over.

**Teach the thinking:**
"Walk me through your logic"
"What criteria did you use to decide?"
"How did you prioritize these options?"

**Build their judgment:**
"What's your confidence level in this recommendation?"
"What could go wrong?"
"What would you do differently next time?"

## The Development Conversation

Different people need different delegation approaches:

**High skill, high will:** Give them Level 4-5 authority and challenging projects
**High skill, low will:** Understand what's missing (challenge, growth, recognition)
**Low skill, high will:** Give them Level 2-3 authority with coaching and support
**Low skill, low will:** Start with Level 1 tasks and determine if it's a skill or motivation issue

**Key question:** "What kind of work energizes you?" Use delegation to align with their strengths and interests when possible.

## Your Weekly Delegation Review

**Monday:** What are you doing this week that someone else could do?
**Wednesday:** How are your current delegations progressing?
**Friday:** What did you learn about your team's capabilities this week?

**Monthly:** What can you delegate next month that you didn't think was possible to delegate this month?

The goal isn't to delegate everything. It's to delegate enough that you're focused on work only you can do while developing your team's capabilities.

Remember: Every time you solve a problem instead of helping them solve it, you get busier and they get weaker. Every time you help them solve it themselves, you get stronger as a manager and they get stronger as contributors.
