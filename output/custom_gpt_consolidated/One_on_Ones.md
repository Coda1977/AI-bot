# One-on-Ones

## Progress, Not Performance

The biggest mistake managers make in 1:1s is treating them like performance reviews.

1:1s aren't about evaluating what happened. They're about creating what happens next.

Teresa Amabile's research on what makes people happiest at work: **progress toward meaningful goals**.

Not completion. Not recognition. Not money.

Progress.

Your job in 1:1s is to create momentum, remove obstacles, and help people see their forward movement.

## The Progress-Focused Framework

Every 1:1 should answer three questions:

**What progress have you made since we last talked?**
Not "what did you accomplish" but "what moved forward." Small wins count. Learning counts. Overcoming obstacles counts.

**What obstacles are slowing you down?**
Not "what problems do you have" but "what's preventing progress." Be specific about barriers, not general about frustrations.

**What's one thing we can do to accelerate your progress?**
Not "what do you need" but "what would create the most momentum." Focus on the highest-leverage action.

## The Energy Audit

Your most important job as a manager: Help people spend more time on work that energizes them and less time on work that drains them.

**The energy questions:**

"What work energized you most this week?"
"What work drained you most this week?"
"What would you like to do more of?"
"What would you like to do less of?"

**Track patterns over time:**
- Which tasks consistently energize them?
- Which tasks consistently drain them?
- How can you give them more energizing work?
- How can you minimize or eliminate draining work?

This isn't about making work "fun." It's about sustainable performance. People perform better on work that energizes them.

## The Learning-It-All Approach

From your core materials: Shift from "know-it-all" to "learn-it-all."

**Know-it-all questions:**
"Did you complete the project?"
"Are you meeting your goals?"
"Any problems I should know about?"

**Learn-it-all questions:**
"What did you learn from that project?"
"What would you do differently next time?"
"What skills do you want to develop?"

**The learning conversation:**
"What's the most interesting challenge you're working on?"
"What's something you figured out recently that you're proud of?"
"What do you want to get better at?"
"What would help you learn faster?"

## Beyond Status Updates

Many 1:1s become glorified status updates. That's a waste of everyone's time.

**Don't ask:** "How are your projects going?"
**Do ask:** "What's the most interesting problem you're solving?"

**Don't ask:** "Any blockers?"
**Do ask:** "What would make your work flow more smoothly?"

**Don't ask:** "Any feedback for me?"
**Do ask:** "What could I do differently to support you better?"

## The Relationship Investment

1:1s are your primary tool for building trust and understanding with each team member.

**Relationship-building questions:**
"What motivates you at work?"
"What work environment brings out your best?"
"What should I know about how you prefer to receive feedback?"
"What's important to you outside of work?"

**Investment, not interrogation:**
Share something about yourself too. 1:1s should be conversations, not interviews.

## The Career Development Conversation

**Monthly career question:** "What do you want to be known for?"

Not "what's your five-year plan" but "what reputation do you want to build?"

**Follow-up questions:**
"What would you need to learn to get there?"
"What experiences would build that reputation?"
"How can your current work contribute to that goal?"
"What opportunities should we look for?"

**The development audit:**
"What skills are you building in your current role?"
"What skills do you want to build?"
"What's the gap between those two lists?"

## Problem-Solving vs. Coaching

Know when to solve and when to coach.

**Solve when:**
- They lack information you have
- They need resources only you can provide
- Time pressure requires quick decisions
- They specifically ask for your advice

**Coach when:**
- They need to develop problem-solving skills
- They have the information but haven't processed it
- Multiple good solutions exist
- You want to build their ownership

**The coaching transition:**
Instead of jumping to solutions, ask: "What options are you considering?"

## The Feedback Loop

1:1s are perfect for giving ongoing feedback, not saving it for formal reviews.

**The weekly feedback question:** "What's one thing I noticed you did well this week?"

**The monthly development question:** "What's one thing you could do differently to be even more effective?"

Make feedback specific and actionable. Connect it to their goals and development areas.

## Common 1:1 Mistakes

**Making them too infrequent**
Monthly isn't enough for building relationships and providing support.

**Making them too short**
30 minutes is minimum. 45-60 minutes for complex situations or new team members.

**Always cancelling them**
This signals that 1:1s aren't important. Protect this time.

**Letting them become status updates**
Use other meetings for project updates. Use 1:1s for development and relationship building.

**Talking more than they do**
If you're talking more than 30% of the time, you're not listening enough.

## The 1:1 Agenda Template

**Check-in (5 minutes):**
How are you doing overall? What's on your mind?

**Progress review (15 minutes):**
What progress have you made? What obstacles are you facing?

**Development focus (15 minutes):**
What are you learning? What do you want to get better at?

**Support and resources (5 minutes):**
How can I help? What do you need from me?

**Forward planning (5 minutes):**
What are your priorities for next week? What should we discuss next time?

**Let them drive the agenda:**
"What's most important for us to discuss today?"

## Preparing for 1:1s

**Before the meeting:**
- Review their recent work and contributions
- Think about development opportunities
- Consider feedback you want to share
- Prepare questions about their goals and challenges

**During the meeting:**
- Put away your laptop and phone
- Take notes on development items and commitments
- Ask follow-up questions
- Listen more than you talk

**After the meeting:**
- Follow up on any commitments you made
- Send resources or connections you promised
- Document development themes and progress

## Your 1:1 Effectiveness Check

**After each 1:1, ask yourself:**
- Did they do most of the talking?
- Did we discuss their development and growth?
- Did I learn something new about them or their work?
- Did they leave feeling heard and supported?
- Do I have specific actions to help them?

**Monthly 1:1 review:**
- Which team members seem most engaged in their 1:1s?
- What topics come up repeatedly across the team?
- How are people progressing toward their goals?
- What patterns do I notice in motivation and energy?

Remember: 1:1s are your most important management tool. Use them to build relationships, accelerate development, and create progress toward meaningful goals.
