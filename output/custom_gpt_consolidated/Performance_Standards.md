# Performance Standards

## The Score Takes Care of Itself

Bill Walsh story from the Manager Core materials:

1978 – The 49ers were the worst team in NFL history: 14 defeats and 2 victories.

Three years later, Bill Walsh pulled off the biggest turnaround in NFL history and led them to a Super Bowl victory.

How?

He refused to focus on winning. He focused on implementing a seemingly simple set of predictable actions and attitudes that governed the work.

Walsh called it "The Standard of Performance."

## Why Trivial Details Matter

It's tempting to tell ourselves a story: Big achievements are the result of big actions.

It's a compelling narrative. All you need to do is find that one big 'thing' and you'll achieve everything.

The reality? It's the deceptively little actions, applied consistently, that make the highest possible contribution toward your goals.

**Diet example from the materials:**
- Don't consume white flour, sugar, milk
- Eat as much vegetables as you'd like
- Stop eating at 8pm
- Use smaller dishes

Nothing revolutionary. Everything measurable. Consistently applied.

Success is in the trivial matters.

## What Are Performance Standards?

Performance standards are rules, codes, and guidelines that direct actions and move the needle.

**These standards ARE NOT:**
- Lofty value statements like "teamwork" or "ownership"
- Mission statements
- Corporate values
- Aspirational goals

**Performance standards ARE:**
- Specific behaviors
- Observable actions
- Measurable practices
- Things you can coach to

**Your standards are what made you good at your job.** Surfacing them is difficult because they've become automatic.

## Real Examples from Your Materials

**Validation VP Example:**
- Pass rate IS NOT interesting. Coverage and product failures are the interesting part
- Be a system engineer! Don't just write code to Git
- We are not a web application company. Take the code all the way to the systems and observe the system impact
- Constantly invest effort in shifting left
- QA should be the basic and most useful virtue of every System Validation Engineer
- Validate the final outcome of the test

**Hotel Example:**
- Let guests know what you can do, not what you can't do
- Never allow guests to do something for themselves that you can do for them
- Be consistent—remember that you're "on stage" all of the time
- 15-10-5: Focus your attention on any guest within 15 feet; smile and make eye contact with any guest within 10 feet; and greet any guest within 5 feet—never turn your back to a guest
- Assume that anyone who walks in the door is a VIP and treat them as such

Notice these are specific, actionable, and observable.

## The Four Questions for Setting Standards

From Manager Core materials:

**What is the purpose of this team?**
What would happen if you all went on vacation tomorrow? Who would suffer? Who do you serve?

**How do we define success?**
How would we measure it? What are the outcomes that matter?

**What behaviors predict this success?**
What are the performance standards? Who is above and below the line?

**What is my legacy?**
What do I want to say I have achieved after leaving this team?

## Creating Your Team's Performance Standards

**Step 1: Identify what great looks like**

Think about your best performer. What do they do differently?

- How do they communicate with clients?
- How do they handle mistakes?
- How do they prioritize work?
- How do they collaborate with teammates?
- How do they approach learning?

**Step 2: Make it specific and observable**

Bad standard: "Communicate effectively"
Good standard: "Respond to client emails within 4 hours, even if just to acknowledge receipt and provide timeline for full response"

Bad standard: "Take ownership"
Good standard: "When something goes wrong, first question is 'What could I have done differently?' not 'Why did this happen?'"

**Step 3: Connect to outcomes**

Each standard should connect to a business result or team effectiveness measure.

"Why does this standard matter?"
"What happens when people follow it?"
"What happens when they don't?"

**Step 4: Test for clarity**

Can someone new to the team read your standards and know exactly what to do?

Can you observe whether someone is following the standard?

Can you coach someone to improve against the standard?

## Sample Performance Standards by Function

**For Sales Teams:**
- Contact new leads within 2 hours of assignment
- Send follow-up summary within 24 hours of every client meeting
- Ask for referrals in every successful closing conversation
- Update CRM status within same day of any client interaction

**For Customer Success Teams:**
- Proactively check in with clients 48 hours before any milestone
- When a client raises an issue, first response acknowledges the concern and provides timeline for resolution
- Never say "that's not possible" without first saying "here's what we can do"
- End every client conversation with "What else can I help you with?"

**For Engineering Teams:**
- Code review comments focus on improving the solution, not criticizing the author
- Every pull request includes reasoning for the approach taken
- When production issues arise, first priority is customer impact, second is root cause
- Technical debt items are logged and prioritized monthly, not ignored

**For Marketing Teams:**
- Every campaign has defined success metrics before launch
- Failed campaigns get post-mortem analysis within one week
- Campaigns always include clear call-to-action and conversion tracking
- Creative reviews focus on audience impact, not personal preferences

## Implementing Performance Standards

**Don't:** Send an email with 15 new standards

**Do:** Introduce one standard at a time

**Week 1:** Introduce the standard and explain why it matters
**Week 2:** Coach to the standard when you see deviations
**Week 3:** Recognize when people follow the standard
**Week 4:** Make following the standard automatic through consistent reinforcement

**Month 2:** Add the next standard

## The Standards Conversation

When someone isn't meeting a standard:

**Step 1: Reference the standard**
"Our standard is to respond to client emails within 4 hours"

**Step 2: State the gap**
"The Johnson email from yesterday morning didn't get a response until this morning"

**Step 3: Ask for their perspective**
"What got in the way of meeting our response standard?"

**Step 4: Problem-solve together**
"How can we ensure you can meet this standard consistently?"

**Step 5: Recommit**
"Can I count on you to meet our 4-hour standard going forward?"

Don't debate whether the standard is reasonable. That's a separate conversation.

## Common Standard-Setting Mistakes

**Making them too complex**
Standards should be simple enough to remember and apply consistently.

**Making them too vague**
"Excellent customer service" isn't a standard. "Greet every customer within 30 seconds of entry" is.

**Having too many at once**
Start with 3-5 core standards. Add more only after the first ones are automatic.

**Not connecting to outcomes**
Standards feel arbitrary if people don't understand why they matter.

**Inconsistent enforcement**
If you don't coach to the standards consistently, they become suggestions.

## The Standards Assessment

**Monthly team review:**

**Which standards are we following consistently?** (Celebrate these)

**Which standards need more attention?** (Focus coaching here)

**What new standards might we need?** (As situations change)

**Are our standards producing the outcomes we want?** (Adjust if needed)

**Individual review:**

**For each team member:**
- Which standards are they strongest at?
- Which standards need development?
- How do their standards impact team performance?
- What coaching do they need?

## Your Four Performance Standards Exercise

Write four performance standards for your team using this template:

**Standard 1:** [Specific behavior]
**Why it matters:** [Connection to results]
**Observable indicator:** [How you'll know it's happening]

**Standard 2:** [Specific behavior]
**Why it matters:** [Connection to results]
**Observable indicator:** [How you'll know it's happening]

**Standard 3:** [Specific behavior]
**Why it matters:** [Connection to results]
**Observable indicator:** [How you'll know it's happening]

**Standard 4:** [Specific behavior]
**Why it matters:** [Connection to results]
**Observable indicator:** [How you'll know it's happening]

**Test questions:**
- Can someone new to the team read these and know exactly what to do?
- Can you observe whether someone is following each standard?
- Do these standards, if followed consistently, lead to the outcomes you want?

Remember: The score takes care of itself when you focus on the standards that create the score.
