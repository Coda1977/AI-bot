# Feedback Conversations

## The Brutal Truth About Feedback

30% of feedback makes performance worse.

Not "doesn't help"—actively makes things worse.

That's from a meta-analysis of 607 studies on feedback effectiveness. Nearly one-third of the time, feedback decreases performance.

Why? Because most managers give garbage feedback like:

- "Be more assertive"
- "Show more initiative"
- "Improve your communication"
- "Be more strategic"

This isn't feedback. It's useless advice about personality change.

## The Four-Step Formula That Works

Real feedback follows this exact structure:

**Step 1: The Action**

What did they actually DO? Be specific enough that a camera could have recorded it.

Bad: "You're not responsive to clients"
Good: "Genesis emailed you Monday at 9am. You replied Wednesday at 4pm."

**Step 2: The Outcome**

What happened because of their action? This answers "why are we having this conversation?"

"Genesis is now threatening to cancel their contract. The CMO called me directly."

**Step 3: Alternative Actions**

Not what they should BE (personality) but what they should DO (behavior).

"Even if you don't have an answer, reply within 4 hours saying 'I got your email and will have an answer by [specific time].'"

**Step 4: Impact on Them**

Show how the change helps THEM, not just you or the company.

"Quick responses build trust. Trusted people get the interesting projects and autonomy. You hate being micromanaged—this is how you prevent it."

## Complete Example

**Action:** "In yesterday's team meeting, when Sarah presented her idea, you immediately listed three reasons it wouldn't work."

**Outcome:** "Sarah stopped contributing. The team lost her perspective for the rest of the meeting."

**Alternative:** "Next time, ask 'What would need to be true for this to work?' before raising concerns."

**Impact:** "You want to be seen as strategic, not negative. Building on ideas before critiquing them shows strategic thinking."

## What Doesn't Work: The Personality Trap

Never give feedback about who someone IS. Only about what they DO.

**Useless personality feedback:**
- "Be more confident"
- "Show leadership"
- "Be more strategic"
- "Be less aggressive"

**Useful behavioral feedback:**
- "Make eye contact with three people when presenting"
- "Run the client meeting yourself instead of deferring to me"
- "Connect your proposals to quarterly goals"
- "Lower your voice and slow down when disagreeing"

People can't change who they are. They can change what they do.

## Challenge Directly and Care Personally: The Radical Candor Approach

From the giving feedback materials: The number 1 problem with feedback is that 30% of the time it harms performance.

The solution? Challenge directly AND care personally.

**The Four Quadrants:**

Care Personally + Challenge Directly = **Radical Candor** (Growth, Big change)
Care Personally + Don't Challenge = **Dysfunctional Empathy** (Small change)
Don't Care + Challenge Directly = **Brutal Honesty** (Defense)
Don't Care + Don't Challenge = **Insincerity** (No change, Mistrust)

**Abstract feedback does not work:**
- "You don't show strategic thinking"
- "Work on communication skills"
- "Lack accountability/ownership"

**Personality feedback does not work:**
- "Be taller" (Not assertive)
- "You are intimidating"
- "Lack presence"

**Focusing on the future works:**
What they will do, not what they did.

## The Situation-Behavior-Impact-Next Step Model

From the formal training materials:

**Situation or Context** - Start with the Situation
**Behavior** – What did they do or not do? Focus on activities and behaviors
**Impact** – What impact did it have on the situation? (lost account, buggy code, attrition)
**New behavior and Impact** – What should they do in the future? What will be its impact?

**Real Example from the Materials:**

"We were in a meeting with client xyz, and they were anxious over our product stability. When they shared their feedback, you pushed back, trying to prove them wrong, which just made them angrier. In the future, I wish you would allow them to fully vent (even encourage that venting), take responsibility for product stability (it is okay to say we are not perfect and that it is our mistake), and work with the client to create a timeline for us fixing this issue. I think this will build a great relationship with our client (and other possibly angry clients)."

## When Feedback Goes Wrong: The Amygdala Hijack

When someone reacts defensively to feedback, their amygdala has been hijacked. They're not thinking—they're in fight-or-flight mode.

**How to react:**

1. Give their feelings a name: "I can see this feels uncomfortable"
2. Remind them of your intention: "We are here to learn and help you succeed"
3. Acknowledge that you might have induced their reaction, and that you are sorry
4. Allow them to clarify their feelings
5. Suggest to get back to the matter or take a time-out before coming back into the conversation
6. Get back on topic

**Key principle:** Assume people can change. Challenge directly and care personally.

## The FeedForward Alternative

Sometimes feedback about the past isn't what's needed. Marshall Goldsmith's FeedForward approach focuses entirely on future improvement.

**FeedForward principles:**
- Focused on a future you can change, not a past you cannot change
- No judging or critiquing of the person or ideas
- You learn from a diverse perspective
- You can really listen because you don't feel defensive
- No feedback about the past (and all the emotional baggage) is allowed

**The FeedForward Process:**

1. **Pick a Behavior** - Choose one specific behavior to improve
2. **Respond** - Create a "speech" for stakeholders:
   - Thank them for feedback
   - Mention your strengths
   - Advertise the one behavior you want to improve
   - Apologize for the impact
   - Ask for ideas for the future

3. **Follow Up** - Regular check-ins to advertise your improvement

**Sample FeedForward Speech:**
"I just got 360° feedback. Thank you for participating. A lot of my feedback is positive—ethical, dedicated, hardworking. I'm grateful for that. AND there is something I would like to improve. In the past, I have come off as somewhat stubborn, trying to win too much. If I've done that to you, I am sorry. Please give me some ideas to help me be a more positive and open-minded listener in the future."

## The Timing Rule

Feedback has a half-life. Wait a week, lose 50% impact. Wait a month, might as well not bother.

But don't ambush. Schedule it:

"I want to discuss how the client meeting went. Can we talk this afternoon?"

This gives them time to prepare mentally and recall the situation.

## The Preparation Requirement

Never give feedback spontaneously. Write it out first:

1. What specific action? (Camera test)
2. What measurable outcome? (Numbers, relationships, results)
3. What alternative behavior? (Exact steps)
4. What personal benefit? (For them, not you)

If you can't fill all four, you're not ready. You're about to give garbage feedback that makes things worse.

## The Repeat Offender Protocol

**First conversation:** Focus on positive impact of changing
**Second conversation:** Include negative impact of not changing
**Third conversation:** This is now a performance issue, not feedback

If you're having the same feedback conversation three times, feedback isn't the tool you need.

## Balancing Your Level of Detail

From the materials: Balancing your level of detail in good and bad works (and it allows you to skip sugarcoating).

Don't do feedback sandwiches. They dilute the message.

Use facts AND experience as sources of knowledge.

Respect the Dunning-Kruger effect: When we're not good at a task, we don't know enough to accurately assess our ability. Inexperience casts the illusion of expertise.

When we lack the knowledge and skills to achieve excellence, we sometimes lack the knowledge and skills to judge excellence.

## Your Weekly Practice

Think of feedback you've been avoiding. Write it out:

1. The exact behavior (what a camera would see)
2. The business impact (specific, measurable)
3. The alternative action (precisely what to do differently)
4. Their personal win (how it helps them, not you)

If you can't connect the change to their personal benefit, question whether you're asking for the right change.

Then have the conversation within 48 hours. Use your notes. Don't wing it.

Say exactly what they did, exactly what happened, exactly what to do differently, and exactly how it helps them.

That specificity is the difference between feedback that changes behavior and feedback that just annoys people.
