# Strengths and Development

## The Precision of Pain and the Blurriness of Joy

We remember our failures in vivid detail but struggle to articulate our successes.

Think about your last big mistake at work. You can probably recall exactly what happened, what you said, who was there, how you felt.

Now think about your last big success. The details are fuzzier, aren't they?

This is why most development focuses on fixing weaknesses instead of building strengths. Pain is precise. Joy is blurry.

But here's what research shows: You have far more potential in your areas of strength than in your areas of weakness.

## What's Working, and How Can I Do More of It?

Most managers ask: "What's broken, and how do I fix it?"

Better question: "What's working, and how can we do more of it?"

**Example from the materials:** UK pub business study
- Renovating low-performing pubs created 15% sales increase for one year, then declined
- Renovating high-performing pubs created 95% increase in sales

**The insight:** You get better returns from amplifying what's already working than from fixing what's broken.

## The Strengths Research

From Gallup's study of 10,885 work units (308,798 employees):

"Do you have a chance to use your strengths every day?"
- Only 20% strongly agreed
- But in units that scored above the median: 44% increase in customer loyalty, 38% increase in productivity

**The difference between teams that use strengths vs. teams that don't:**
- 66% return vs. 285% return on development investment

## Switch vs. Dial

Taking someone from terrible to average is like flipping a switch. It's possible, but it requires enormous effort and produces limited results.

Taking someone from good to great is like turning a dial. Small adjustments produce significant improvements.

**Problematic assumption #1:** Each person's greatest room for growth is in their areas of greatest weakness.

**Reality:** Taking a behavior from +10 to +40 takes about the same effort as going from -10 to -4, but produces much better results.

**Problematic assumption #2:** Each person can be competent in almost anything.

**Reality:** Well-roundedness is a fallacy. Talent is jagged.

## What Is a Strength?

A strength isn't just something you're good at. It's the intersection of three things:

**Talent:** Your natural patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving
**Skills:** The knowledge and abilities you've developed
**Experience:** The practice and learning you've accumulated

**Strength = Talent × Skills × Experience**

You can develop skills and gain experience in any area. But talent is where you have the most potential for excellence.

## How to Spot Strengths

**Yearning:** What activities are they naturally drawn to?
**Rapid Learning:** What do they pick up quickly?
**Flow:** What activities do they do naturally, without thinking about the steps?
**Glimpses of Excellence:** When do they show moments of unexpected brilliance?
**Satisfaction:** What work gives them energy during or immediately after?

**Red thread questions:**
- When was the last time you lost track of time at work?
- When did you instinctively volunteer for something?
- When did someone have to tear you away from what you were doing?
- When did you feel completely in control?
- When did you surprise yourself with how well you did?

## The Four Strength Domains

From StrengthsFinder research, strengths fall into four categories:

**Executing:** People who know how to make things happen
*Examples: Achiever, Discipline, Focus, Responsibility*

**Influencing:** People who know how to take charge and speak up
*Examples: Command, Communication, Competition, Maximizer*

**Relationship Building:** People who build strong relationships
*Examples: Empathy, Harmony, Includer, Relator*

**Strategic Thinking:** People who help teams consider what could be
*Examples: Analytical, Futuristic, Ideation, Strategic*

**Team application:** Make sure your team has representation from all four domains.

## Strengths-Based Feedback

Traditional feedback: "You're really good at presentations"
Strengths-based feedback: "Your ability to connect with the audience and simplify complex ideas made that presentation especially effective"

**The strengths feedback formula:**
1. **What was the event?** (Specific situation)
2. **What did they do?** (Observable behavior)
3. **What strength does it imply?** (Natural talent or skill)
4. **What was the impact?** (Results on event, outcome, people)

**Example:** "In yesterday's client meeting (event), you asked questions that helped them clarify their real needs (behavior). Your ability to listen deeply and ask insightful questions (strength) helped us understand what they actually want, which will make our proposal much stronger (impact)."

## Development Paths for Strengths

**Inconsistent Strength:** They show it sometimes but not consistently
*Approach:* "You're showing it here... try to show it there as well." New experiences to practice the strength.

**Consistent and Well-Developed Strength:** They use it regularly and effectively
*Approach:* New strategies and advanced applications. Coaching to maximize impact.

**Dysfunctional Strength:** They overuse the strength or use it inappropriately
*Approach:* Help them understand when and how to dial it back.

## Coaching Dysfunctional Strengths

Strong talents can become weaknesses when overused:

**Achievement orientation** can become workaholism
**Analytical thinking** can become analysis paralysis
**Empathy** can become taking on others' emotions
**Strategic thinking** can become disconnection from execution

**Coaching questions for dysfunctional strengths:**
- How does it look when this strength becomes dysfunctional?
- What price do you pay when you overuse this strength?
- How can you use this strength more effectively?

## The Manager's Focus

**What most managers do:**
- Bell curve performance management
- Competency models focused on weaknesses
- Weakness-focused feedback and development
- Learn from failure
- Compare people to each other

**What managers could do:**
- Strengths-based feedback and development
- Ensure 20% of each person's work is in their strength zone
- Learn from success
- Compare people to their own previous versions

## Power Recognition

From your core materials: This is a weekly practice. At least once a week, recognize the specific effort people put into projects.

**Old way:** "You made an awesome feature" or "You really got us ahead on this project"

**New way:** Address the specific or nuanced things that person did to deliver that feature or advance the project. This reinforces the behavior to occur again.

**Power recognition formula:**
- **Specific behavior:** What exactly did they do?
- **Strength demonstrated:** What talent or skill did this show?
- **Impact created:** How did this benefit the team, project, or customer?

## Building a Strengths-Based Team

**Step 1:** Identify each person's top strengths
- Use formal assessments like StrengthsFinder
- Have strength-focused conversations
- Observe when they perform best

**Step 2:** Align work with strengths
- Give people tasks that use their natural talents
- Create roles that maximize strengths
- Partner people with complementary strengths

**Step 3:** Develop strengths systematically
- Focus development on strength areas
- Provide challenges that stretch their talents
- Connect them with mentors who share similar strengths

**Step 4:** Manage around weaknesses
- Don't ignore weaknesses, manage around them
- Partner them with people who are strong where they're weak
- Use systems and processes to compensate
- Focus only on weaknesses that prevent strength expression

## Your Strengths Assessment

**For yourself:**
- What work energizes you most?
- What do colleagues ask for your help with?
- What achievements are you most proud of?
- When do you feel most confident and capable?

**For each team member:**
- What are their top 3-5 strengths?
- How much of their work uses these strengths?
- What development would amplify their strengths?
- How can you give them more strength-based work?

**Team strengths audit:**
- Which strength domains are well-represented?
- Which domains are missing or weak?
- How can you recruit or develop missing strengths?
- How can people with similar strengths learn from each other?

Remember: Don't try to put in what was left out. Try to draw out what was left in. That's hard enough.
