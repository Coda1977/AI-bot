She began her career on the staff of Cyrus Eaton, the industrialist who founded the famous Pugwash Conferences of nuclear scientists. Working as part of the team that organ­ ized and ran the conferences, she received sound training in tackling the problems of communicating clearly on technical subjects. In 1961 she left Mr. Eaton to attend the Harvard Business School, returning to Cleveland in 1963 to join McKinsey & Company, the interna­ tional management consulting firm, as their first female consultant. Her ability to write was noted, and she was transferred to London in 1966, to concentrate on developing the writing skills of their growing European staff. All reports at",

However, it became apparent to her very quickly that the writing diffi­ culties in Dusseldorf and Paris were the same as those in New York and Cleveland. The problem was not so much to get the language right as to get the thinking clear. This insight led her to concentrate on discovering the structures of thinking that must underlie clear writing; and eventually to develop the ideas that make up this book. She still lives in London, but has since 1973 run her own firm, Minto International, Inc. She specializes in teaching The Pyramid Principle to people whose major training is in business or the professions, but whose jobs nevertheless require them to produce complex reports, analyses, memorandums, or presentations. She has taught her course to most of the major consulting firms in the United States and Europe, as well as to many of the country's largest cor­ porations. She has also lectured at the Harvard, Stanford, Chicago, and London business schools, and at the State University of New York. === Page 10 === xii This book proposes to tell you how to use The Pyramid Principle to write a clear business document. Writing anything clearly consists of two steps: first, decide the point you want to make, then put it into words. So long as you know the point, you rarely have a problem stating it • Please leave two quarts today. • I'll meet you at 12:30 at Mario's. • Call your wife. But you can run into trouble when you have to sort through a series of points to come to an overall conclusion: What the author has done here is what most people do when they write. He has used the writing process as a device to formulate his think­ ing. As a device it works quite well, in fact, but the result is a bit hard on the reader, who is forced to plow through several irrelevant sentences before he finds the point. How much easier if the note had read: •ctiu1<l V\\(e:r~~cn~ay1~:t~clay's ineitthgJot~ufaaay~t foi16&1T91~, .. · .. ·.·.····•·· . , ... vv<Jura be ~orecopv~nientJof \\:dlllns andjofinson,'a'11&vv0ura .als~. · · :~· ~erDJitCH~~.~d·}%~;be:pie,s~nt,:. z.L•····;· • ··· ·;i(.i.;~;;;f _.'.1:·~·1; ;;r.J ~ojjt Alas, to get from the first example to the second means double work",

No doubt they're right. But what happens when, instead of the document's being one paragraph long, it is two or three pages? Usually the author feels it would take too long to revise it, and in any case he's often not sure just how to go about doing the revision. Much easier, he decides, to leave it to the reader to sort === Page 11 === PREFACE through the points and pull out the message for himself. Until recently few readers actually complained about this attitude on the part of their correspondents. Most took it for granted that this was how business writing was supposed to look, since it resembled what they themselves had learned to produce by careful copying of their superiors. Indeed, I can recall once telling a consultant that his 2-hour presentation on a company's new organization structure was boring. He replied: Perhaps. But the time wasted is enormous, and continual exposure to badly written, boring documents can only be soul destroying. As one com­ mentator sympathetically noted, 'The myth that businessmen don't read is nonsense. They read a lot. But what they read is illiterate.' For the average business or professional writer, producing more literate memos and reports does not mean writing shorter sentences or choosing better words. Rather, it means formally separating the thinking process from the writing process, so that you can complete your thinking before you begin to write. And that's what this book will tell you how to do. Essentially it will tell you that it is the order in which you present your thinking that makes your writing clear or unclear, and that you cause con­ fusion in the reader's mind when you do not impose the proper order. Imposing the proper order means creating a comprehensive structure that identifies the major ideas and their flow, and organizes the minor ideas to support them. The key skill, then, is to be able to recognize which are your major and which your minor ideas, and to work out their relationships within the structure. The demands of logic and the limitations of a reader's ability to take in information dictate that this structure ·will always be pyramidal in shape -hence The Pyramid Principle. Part One will both explain this principle",

Part Two will show you how to use your knowl­ edge of the pyramid rules to look critically at this structure, find its logical flaws, and push your thinking creatively so that you end up saying pre­ cisely what you mean. The approach is applicable to any document in which your purpose is to get your thinking across clearly. Applying it, however, requires considerable discipline. Nevertheless, by deliberately forcing yourself to think first and write later in the manner it suggests, you should be able quite dramatically (a) to cut down the time you normally need to produce a final draft, (b) to increase its clarity, and (c) to decrease its length. QJ xiii === Page 15 === One of the least pleasant aspects of a professional person's job is the need to put things in writing. Almost everyone finds it a chore and wishes he were better at it. And many people are told specifically that they need to improve if they want to progress. The reason most people don't improve is that they assume that writing more clearly means writing simpler, more direct sentences. And it is true that the sentences in their documents are often overlong and unwieldy. Moreover, their language is frequently too technical or too abstract, and their paragraphs on occasion are awkwardly developed. But these are weaknesses of style, and it is notoriously difficult for a person who has completed the formal part of his education to change his writing style. Not that it cannot be done; rather, it's like learning to type. It requires a good many repetitive exercises, for which most on-the-job writers in industry and government simply cannot find the time. As a result, they continue to be told they need to write 'more clearly.' However, there is a second cause of unclear writing, far more pervasive than the first, and much easier to correct. This relates to the structure of the document -the order in which the sentences appear regardless of whether they are well or poorly written. If a person's writing is unclear, it is most likely because the ordering of the ideas conflicts with the capability of the reader's mind to process them. This capability is the same for everyone, whether reader or writer, so that learning to accommodate it is a relatively easy task. And",

This first section of the book explains why the structure in a reader's mind will always be a pyramid, and what the logical substructures are that make up that pyramid. It tells you how to use this knowledge to identify the ideas you need to include in a particular document, and to structure a clear rela­ tionship between them. Finally, it tells you how to highlight your structure so that the ideas and their relationships will be easy to see at a glance. 3 === Page 17 === Why a pyramid structure? The person who seeks to learn what you think about a particular subject by reading what you have to say about it faces a complex task. Even if your document is a short one -say only about 2 single-spaced pages -it will contain roughly 100 sentences. He must take in each of these, digest them, relate them, and hold them together. He will invariably find the job easier if they come to him as a pyramid, beginning at the top and working downward. This conclusion reflects some fundamental findings about the way the mind works. Specifically: • The mind automatically sorts information into distinctive pyramidal groupings in order to comprehend it. • Any grouping of ideas is easier to comprehend if it arrives presorted into its pyramid. o This suggests that every written document should be deliberately structured to form a pyramid of ideas. The sections following explain what I mean by a pyramid of ideas. Sorting into pyramids . . . That the mind automatically imposes order on everything around it has long been recognized. Essentially, it tends to see any sequence of things that occur together as belonging together, and therefore sets about imposing a logical pattern on them. The Greeks, for example, demonstrated the tendency by looking up at the stars and seeing outlines of figures instead of pinpoints of light. The mind will group together any series of items that it sees as having a 'common fate' -because they share similar characteristics or are near the same place. Take these six dots for example: 5 === Page 18 === 6 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE •• • •• • When looking casually",

The value of seeing things in logical units is, of course, immense. To demonstrate, read the following pairs of nouns,* which are normally not related to each other. LAKE • SUGAR BOOT • PLATE GIRL • KANGAROO PENCIL \" GASOLINE PALACE • BICYCLE RAILROAD • ELEPHANT BOOK • TOOTHPASTE Now try to 'organize' them by picturing a situation in which each one might be associated -such as the sugar being dissolved in the lake or the boot sitting on the plate. Then cover up the list on the right-hand side and try to remember them through reading the list on the left-hand side. Most people find that they can recall them all without hesitation. The same organizing phenomenon takes place when you are either lis­ tening to or reading ideas. You assume the ideas that appear together, one after the other, belong together, and attempt to impose a logical pat­ tern on them.

Some minds can hold as many as nine items, while others can hold only five (I'm a five myself). A convenient number is three, but of course the easiest number is one. What this means is that when the mind sees the number of items with which it is being presented begin to rise above four or five, it starts to group them into logical categories so that they can be retained. In this case, it would probably put the items into categories that reflect the sec­ tions of the supermarket you would need to visit. To demonstrate how this helps, read the list below and categorize each idea in this way as you come to it. You will very likely find that you remember them all. * Miller, George A.

DAIRY PRODUCTS VEGETABLES Potatoes Carrots The need to state the logic Now clearly, it is not enough simply to group the ideas in a logical way without also stating to yourself what the logic of the relationship is. The point in grouping was not just to move from a set of nine items to sepa­ rate sets of four, two, and three items. That still comes to nine. What you want to do is move above the nine, to three. This means that instead of remembering each of the nine items, you remember only the three categories into which they fall. You are thinking one level of abstraction higher, but because the thought is at a higher level, it suggests the items below it. And, because the relationship is not a contrived one as was the case in the exercise about the lake and the sugar, it is much easier to keep in mind. All mental processes",

If you think about communicating to that mind, you can see that the problem is one of ensuring that what you say will fit somewhere into the existing pyramids. === Page 21 === WHY A PYRAMID STRUCTURE Now we come to the real problem of communicating. You can 'see' these groupings of items quite clearly. To communicate them means to ensure that the other person 'sees' them in the same way. But, as was the case with your wife, you can only present them one by one. Surely, the most efficient way to do this would be to present the category first and then the items. That is, to order the ideas from the top down. Ordering from the top down c t 11. th on ro ing e sequence in which you present your ideas is the single most important act necessary to clear writing. The clearest sequence is always to give the summarizing idea before you give the individual ideas being summarized. I cannot emphasize this point too much. Remember that the reader (or listener) can only take the sentences in one at a time. You know he will assume that those ideas that appear together logically belong together. If you do not tell him in advance what the rela­ tionship is, but simply give the ideas one at a time, he will automatically look for similarities by which he can group the points being expressed, so that he can explain to himself the significance of the groupings. Alas, people being as diverse in background and understanding as they are, they rarely put exactly the same interpretation on your groupings as you do. Indeed, they not infrequently find that they can't see any relationship at all between the ideas in a set. Even if they think exactly as you do, you are making their reading more difficult, since they must supply what is unstated. Let me demonstrate how confusing any order other than top down is with an example.

Now, I have given you a piece of information, and without realizing it you will automatically make some assumptions about the reason for my giving you that information. In other words, you will see this statement as part of a group of ideas not yet expressed, and prepare your mind to receive the rest by assuming a probable purpose behind the statement. This expectancy reduces the strain of analyzing each succeeding idea for all its attributes; you look only for the one in common with what has gone before. 9 === Page 22 === 10 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Thus, you might think such things as, 'She's talking about how uncon­ servative Zurich is getting,' or 'She's going to compare Zurich with other cities,' or even, 'She's hung up on beards and moustaches.'

Can you not feel your mind scrabbling about trying to find a relation­ ship, coming to the conclusion that there is none, and giving up in disgust? The mental strain is simply too great. You must recognize that a reader, no matter how intelligent he is, has only a limited amount of mental energy available to him. Some of it will be used up just recognizing and interpreting the words, a further amount seeing the relationships between the ideas, and whatever is left compre­ hending their significance. You can economize his need to spend time on the first two activities by presenting the ideas so that they can be comprehended with the least pos­ sible mental effort. To sequence them instead so that the mind has to go backward and forward to make connections is simply bad manners, and most readers react by refusing to do so.

Thinking from the bottom up If . t you are going o group and summarize all your information and present it in a top-down manner, it would seem your document would have to look something like the 11 === Page 24 === 12 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE structure in Exhibit 1. The boxes stand for the individual ideas you want to present, with your thinking having begun at the lowest level by forming sentences that you grouped logically into paragraphs. You then grouped the paragraphs into sections, and the sections into the total memorandum·· represented by a single thought at the top. If you think for a moment about what you actually do when you write, you can see that you develop your major ideas by thinking in this bottom-up manner. At the very lowest level in the pyramid, you group together your sen­ tences, each containing an individual idea, into paragraphs. Let us suppose you bring together six sentences into one paragraph. The reason you bring together those six sentences and no others will clearly be that you see a log­ ical relationship between them. And that logical relationship will always be that they are all needed to express the single idea of the paragraph, which is effectively a summary of them. You would not, for example, bring together five sentences on finance and one on tennis, because their relevance to each other would be difficult to express in a single summary sentence. Stating this summary sentence moves you up one level of abstraction and allows you to think of the paragraph as containing one point rather than six. With this act of efficiency you now group together, say, three paragraphs, each containing a single thought at a level of abstraction one step higher than that of the individual sentences. The reason you form a section out of these three paragraphs and no others is that you see a log­ ical relationship between them. And the relationship is once again that they are all needed to express the single idea of the section, which again will be a summary of the three ideas in the paragraphs below them. Exactly the same thinking holds true in bringing the sections together to form the document. You have three sections grouped together (each of which has been built up from groups of paragraphs, which in",

Since you will continue grouping and summarizing until you have no more relationships to make, it is clear that every document you write will always be structured to support only one single thought -the one that summarizes your final set of groupings. This should be the major point you want to make, and all the ideas grouped underneath -provided you have built the structure properly -will serve to explain or defend that point in ever greater detail. Fortunately, you can define in advance whether or not you have built the structure properly by checking to see whether your ideas relate to each other in a way that would permit them to form pyramidal groups. Specifically, they must obey three rules: === Page 25 === 0: ro OJ V> ~­ :::J tO ro -::::;- 0 c tO ::::;-- === Page 26 === 14 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE 1 Ideas at any level in the pyramid must always be summaries of the ideas grouped below them. 2 Ideas in each grouping must always be the same kind of idea. 3 Ideas in each grouping must always be logically ordered. Let me explain why these rules 'must always' apply: 1 Ideas at any level in the pyramid must always be summaries of the ideas grouped below them. The first rule reflects the fact that the major activity you carry out in thinking and writing is that of abstracting to create a new idea out of the ideas grouped below. As we saw above, the point of a paragraph is a summary of its sentences, just as the point of a section is a summary of the points of its paragraphs, etc. However, if you are going to be able to draw a point out of the grouped sentences or paragraphs, these groupings must have been properly formed in the first place. That's where rules 2 and 3 come in. 2 Ideas in each grouping must always be the same kind of idea. If what you want to do is raise your thinking only one level of abstraction above a grouping of ideas, then the ideas in the grouping must be logically the same. For example, you can logically categorize apples and pears one level",

But what if you wanted to group together apples and chairs? You cannot do so at the very next level of abstraction, since that is already taken by fruit and furniture. Thus, you would have to move to a much higher level and call them 'things' or 'inanimate objects,' either of which is far too broad to indicate the logic of the grouping. In writing you want to state the idea directly implied by the logic of the grouping, so the ideas in the grouping must all fall into the same logical category. Thus, if the first idea in a grouping is a reason for doing something, the other ideas in the same grouping must also be reasons for doing the same thing. If the first idea is a step in a process, the rest of the ideas in the grouping must also be steps in the same process. If the first idea is a problem in the company, the others in the grouping must be related problems, and so on. A shortcut in checking your groupings is to be sure that you can clearly label the ideas with a plural noun. Thus, you will find that all the ideas in the grouping will turn out to be things like recommendations, or reasons, or problems, or changes to be made. There is no limitation on the kinds of ideas that may be grouped, but the ideas in each grouping must be of the same kind, able to === Page 27 === WHY A PYRAMID STRUCTURE be described by one plural noun. How you make sure you get like kinds of ideas grouped together each time is explained more fully in Part Two, Chapters 7, 8, and 9. 3 Ideas in each grouping must always be logically ordered. That is, there must be a specific reason why the second idea comes second, and cannot come first or third. How you determine proper order is explained in detail in Chapter 7, Questioning the Order of the Ideas. Essentially it says that there are only four possible logical ways in which to order a set of ideas: \" Deductively (major premise, minor premise, conclusion). • Chronologically (first, second, third). \" Structurally (Boston, New York, Washington). • Comparatively (first most important, second most important, etc.).

If it was formed by reasoning deductively, the ideas go in argu­ ment order; if by working out cause-and-effect relationships, in time order; if by commenting on an existing structure, the order dictated by the struc­ ture; and if by categorizing, order of importance. Since these four activities -reasoning deductively, working out cause-and-effect relationships, divid­ ing a whole into its parts, and categorizing -are the only analytical activities the mind can perform, these are the only orders it can impose. Essentially, then, the key to clear writing is to slot your ideas into this pyramidal form and test them against the rules before you begin to write. If any of the rules is broken, it is an indication that there is a flaw in your thinking, or that the ideas have not been fully developed, or that they are not related in a way that will make their message instantly clear to the reader. You can then work on refining them until they do obey the rules, thus eliminating the need for vast amounts of rewriting later on. 15 === Page 29 === The substructures within the pyramid As Chapter 1 explained, a clear piece of writing establishes a rigid set of relationships between its ideas, so that they will form a comprehensive pyramidal structure (see Exhibit 1 ). It then presents the ideas to the reader, starting at the top and working down each leg. Because of the specificity of the pyramid rules, if you know what your ideas are before you begin to write, you can relatively easily form them into a proper pyramid. Most people when they sit down to write, however, have only a hazy notion of their ideas (if that). Nor should they expect much more. No one can know precisely what he thinks until he has been forced to symbolize it -either by saying it out loud or by writing it down -and even then the first statement of the idea is likely to be less precise than he can eventually make it. Consequently, you cannot hope just to sit down and start arranging your ideas into a pyramid. You have to discover them first.But the pyramid dictates a rigid s.et of substructures that can serve to speed the discovery process. These are: • The vertical relationship between points and subpoints. • The horizontal relationship within",

But that vertical follow-on obscures the fact that the ideas occur at various levels of abstraction. Any idea below the main point will always have both a vertical and a horizontal relationship to the other ideas in the document. The vertical relationship serves marvelously to help capture the reader's attention. It permits you to set up a question/answer dialogue that will pull him with great interest through your reasoning. Why can we be so sure the reader will be interested? Because he will be forced to respond logi­ cally to your ideas. What you put into each box in the pyramid structure is an idea. I define an idea as a statement that raises a question in the reader's mind because you are telling him something he does not know. (Since people do not generally read to find out what they already know, it is fair to state that your primary purpose in writing any document will always be to tell people what they do not know.) Making a statement to a reader that tells him something he does not know will automatically raise a logical question in his mind -for example, Why? or How? or Why do you say that? The writer is now obliged to answer that question horizontally on the line below. In his answer, how­ ever, he will still be telling the reader things he does not know, so he will raise further questions that must again be answered on the line below. The writer will continue to write, raising and answering questions, until he reaches a point at which he judges the reader will have no more logi­ cal questions. (The reader will",

The writer is now free to leave the first leg of the pyramid and go back up to the Key Line to answer the original question raised by the point in the top box. The way to ensure total reader attention, therefore, is to refrain from raising any questions in the reader's mind before you are ready to answer them. Or from answering questions before you have raised them. For example, any time a document presents a section captioned 'Our Assumptions' before it gives the major points, you can be sure the writer is answering questions the reader could not possibly have had an oppor­ tunity to raise. Consequently, the information will have to be repeated (or reread) at the relevant point in the dialogue. The pyramid structure almost magically forces you to present informa­ tion only as the reader needs it. Let me take you through a couple of examples. Exhibit 2, the first one, is a humorous one, from an article by G. K. Chesterton. It will give you an idea of how the question/answer tech­ nique works to hold the reader's attention without burdening you with the need to think about the relevance of the content. === Page 31 === THE SUBSTRUCTURES WITHIN THE PYRAMID Exhibit 2 The pyramid structure establishes a question/answer dialogue Why?

Again, you may have a certain prejudice against the sentiment, but it is clear to you why he says what he says. And it is clear because the grouping of ideas sticks to doing its job of answering the question raised by the point above. The last section, about variations, enters the mind equally clearly. You can see this same technique at work in a piece of business writing (Exhibit 3). Here we have the structure of a 20-page memorandum recom­ mending the purchase of an Internet Cafe franchise. It is a good buy for three reasons, and underneath each reason is the answer to the further question raised in the reader's mind by making this point The reasoning is so clearly Exhibit 3 All documents should reflect the question/answer dialogue Why? Will grow faster than the industry Purchase an Internet Cafe franchise Why? Why? Large market share Little retail com­ petition Will have positive financial impact Why? Low Growing cost sales Separate business Will be easy to absorb === Page 33 === THE SUBSTRUCTURES WITHIN THE PYRAMID stated that the reader is in a position to determine whether he disagrees with the writer's reasoning, and to raise logical questions concerning it. To summarize, then, a great value of the pyramid structure is that it forces visual recognition of this vertical relationship on you as you work out your thinking. Any point you make must raise a question in the reader's mind, which you must answer horizontally on the line below. The horizontal relationship In deciding what to say on the line below, not only must the points you include answer the question raised by the point above, they must also answer it logically.

These are the only two types of logical relationships possible in a grouping. A deductive grouping presents an argument in successive steps. That is, the first idea makes a statement about a situation that exists in the world today. The second idea comments on the subject or the predicate of that statement, and the third idea states the implication of those two situations existing in the world at the same time. Thus, the grouping would have the following form: • Men are mortal. ., Socrates is a man. • Therefore Socrates is mortal. To move up a level of abstraction from a deductive grouping, you summa­ rize the argument, with your summary resting heavily on the final point 'Because Socrates is a man he is mortal.' An inductive grouping, by contrast, will take a set of ideas that are related simply by virtue of the fact that you can describe them all by the same plural noun (reasons for, reasons against, steps, problems, etc.). The form of this argument would be: • French tanks are at the Polish border. • German tanks are at the Polish border. • Russian tanks are at the Polish border. To move upward here, you draw an inference based on your assessment of what is the same about the points -i.e., they are all warlike movements against Poland. Thus, your inference would be something like 'Poland is about to be invaded by tanks.' 21 === Page 34 === 22 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE In writing, if your answer is deductive you know you must have an argument in which the second point comments on the subject or predicate of the first, and the third point draws a 'therefore' from the previous two. If it is inductive, you know the ideas in the grouping must be logically alike and can be designated by a plural noun. Given this knowledge, you can see that any one idea in the pyramid implies all the others. Consequently, you could start to build your pyramid anywhere, with a single idea, adding the other ideas as they were demanded -either up or down or sideways. But there is one more thing you need to know before you venture off to build a pyramid of your own. And that is the question to which your document must give",

The introductory flow We saw earlier that the pyramid structure permits you to carry on a question/answer dialogue with your reader. This question/answer dialogue cannot be counted on to engage his interest unless the statement that starts it off is relevant to him. The only way you can be confident of its relevance is to make sure that it directly answers a question you have identified as already existing in his mind. I said earlier that you write primarily to tell people what they don't know. But a reader wants to find out what he doesn't know only if he needs to do so. If he has no need, he will have no question, and vice versa. Thus, you make sure your document is of interest by directing it toward answering a question that already exists in the reader's mind, or that would exist if he thought for a minute about what is going on around him. The introduction identifies that question by tracing the history of its origin. Since this history will be in the form of a narrative of events, it should follow the classic narrative pattern of development. That is, it should begin by establishing for the reader the time and place of a Situation. In that Situation something will have occurred (known as the Complication) that caused him to raise (or would cause him to raise) the Question to which your document will give him the Answer. This classic pattern of story-telling -Situation, Complication, Question, Answer -permits you to make sure that you and the reader are 'standing in the same place' before you take him by the hand and lead him through your thinking. It also gives you a clear focus for the point at the top of your document, and thus a means of judging that you are conveying the right message in the most direct way. To illustrate, here is an introduction of the kind normally seen in business: === Page 35 === THE SUBSTRUCTURES WITHIN THE PYRAMID The purpose of this memorandum is to pull together some ideas for further reflection and discussion in such questions as: 1 Composition of the Board and. its optimum size. 2 A conception of the broad roles. of the Board and the Executive Committee, the specific responsibilities of each, and the relationships of",

Note how much more easily you comprehend its purpose and message when it is forced to fit the narrative mold: The new organization installed in October places full authority and responsibility for running the day-to-day activities of the two divisions squarely on the shoulders of the managers of those divisions. This lllovefrees the Board to deal entirely with the broad matters of policy and planning that are its exclusive responsibility. However, the Board has for so long oriented itself to dealing with short-term operating problems that it is not presently in a position to focus its attention on long-range strategy development. Consequently, it must consider the changes needed to permit itself to do so. Specifically, we believe it should: • Relinquish responsibility for day-to-day operating matters to the Executive Committee • Broaden its composition to include outside members • Establish policies cind procedures to formalize internal operation. In summary, the introduction tells the reader, in story form, what he already knows or could reasonably be expected to know about the subject you are discussing, and thus reminds him of the question he has to which he can expect the document to give him an answer. The story sets forth the Situation within which a Complication developed that raised the Question to which your document will now give the Answer. Once you state the Answer (the main point at the top of your pyramid), it will raise a new ques­ tion in the reader's mind that you will answer on the line below. 23 === Page 36 === 24 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE What does the existence of these three substructures -i.e., the vertical question/answer dialogue, the horizontal deductive or inductive logic, and the narrative introductory structure -do for you in helping you discover the ideas you need to build a pyramid? Knowing the vertical relationship, you can determine the kind of ideas you need in each grouping (i.e., those that will answer the question). Knowing the horizontal relationship, you can judge that the ideas you bring together are of a like kind (i.e., proper parts of an inductive or deductive argument).",

Naturally, you want to go about applying these insights in an orderly way, and that's what Chapter 3 will tell you how to do. === Page 37 === How to build a pyramid structure The problem you generally face as you sit down to write is that you know roughly what you want to write about, but not specifically what you want to say or how you want to say it. This sense of uncertainty is hardly enhanced by knowing that the ideas you eventually put down, whatever they be, must end up forming a pyramid. Nevertheless, there is a good deal that you do know about your end product that you can build on. To begin with, you know that you will have a sentence at the top of the pyramid that will have a subject and a predi­ cate. You also know that the subject of that sentence will be the subject of your document. In addition, you know that the sentence will serve as the answer to a question that already exists in the reader's mind. And that question will have arisen because of a situation (with which the reader is familiar) within which a complication developed (with which he is also familiar) that raised the question that caused you to need to write in the first place. You may even know roughly some of the points you want to make. That is quite a bit to know. You can use this knowledge in building your pyramid either by starting at the top and working down, or by starting at the bottom and working up. The first way is generally easier than the second, and so should be tried first. The top-down approach . . It 1s generally easier to start at the top and work down because you begin by thinking about the things that it is easiest for you to be sure of -your subject and the reader's knowledge of it, which you will remind him of in the introduction.

The purpose of the entire exercise is to make sure you know what Question it is you are trying to answer. Once you have the Question, every­ thing else falls into place relatively easily. Let me demonstrate how your thinking would develop by using the tech­ nique to rewrite the memorandum shown in Exhibit 5. It comes from the Accounting Department of a large beverage company in the United States. When the company's drivers deliver the product to a customer, they send back to the Accounting Department a delivery ticket with a set of code numbers, the date, and the amount of the delivery. These delivery tickets are the basis of the billing system, which works something like this: FIVE WEEKS Process• delivery tickets Send• bill Receive• check Process Payment One of the company's customers, a hamburger emporium we'll call Big Chief, gets an awful lot of deliveries. For its own accounting purposes, it would like to keep daily track of how the bill is mounting up. It wants to know if it can't keep the delivery tickets along with each delivery, record them on a computer tape, calculate the total, and then send the tape and its check once a month to the headquarters office of the beverage com­ pany. In other words, it is proposing a system that would work like this: ONE DAY Receive tape • and check Process Payment 27 === Page 40 === 28 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Exhibit 5 Original Big Chief Memorandum To: Mr Robert Salmon From: John J. Jackson Subject: Big Chief Date: March 7, 2001 We have been requested to review the feasibility of processing Big Chief's (Parent Number 8306) N/A Delivery Tickets via tape into our National Accounts System. This processing is to be accomplished by Big Chief and us on a prepayment basis. We have completed our review of this request and our findings are as follows: 1. Our primary requirement for accepting any National Accounts data from an outside source is that we receive records in a prescribed format: a. Parent Number b. Outlet Number c. Ticket Number d.

Big Chief will produce an extract program that will be run against their file (A/P Liability) to extract all ticket information presently on that file. The output file created by this program will be in a format acceptable to the N/A subsystem APNND, yash Receipt Advice (see Record Layout). This data, in the form of a tape, will then be sent to us for balancing pur­ poses and at the same time, Big Chief's check, accompanied by a detailed listing of the information on the tape (see Report Layout #1) will be sent to the National Accounts lock box. The tape received by our Data Processing Department will be bal­ anced according to our prescribed procedures. The final result of this balancing is that t he dollar amount of the submitted check and the detail of the tape must 'zero balance' (.OO). 3. Upon completion, the balanced cash tape will be processed through the National Accounts System. This will produce a matchup by ticket number against the N/A Updated Statement History file and the production of National Syrup Account Billing Statements. ; === Page 41 === HOW TO BUILD A PYRAMID STRUCTURE The head of the Accounting Department has been asked if the change would be feasible, and has answered in his present memorandum by saying essentially, 'Here's how the new system would work,' without actu­ ally answering the question.

(Yes.) 4 Now let me check that that is really the Question and really the Answer by thinking through the introduction. To do that I take the Subject and move up to the Situation. The first sentence of the Situation must be a statement about the Subject. What is the first noncontroversial thing I can think of to say about the Subject - something I know the reader will not_R~, but will accept as fact? (They have requested a changi··-rn~the procedure.)

Since that's roughly what you've stated as your Question, you can see that both it and the Answer match, so you have proved that the point you are making is valid for the reader. 6 Given the statement that the change does make sense, you can now move down to determine what New Question would be raised in the reader's mind by your stating it to him. (Why?) 7 The answer to any Why? question is always 'Reasons', so you know that the points you need across the Key Line must all be reasons. What might your reasons be? • It will give us the information we need. • It will increase our cash flow. • It will reduce our work load. 8 After determining that in fact these points are the right points and in logical order, you can move down and spell out what you need to say to support each one. In the case of so short a document, however, you can probably get away with assuming they are easily available in your mind and will come to you as you get to each sec­ tion to write it. As you can see, the technique has forced the writer to draw from his mind only the information that will be relevant to the reader's question. But in doing so, it has helped push his thinking to deal fully with the question, rather than only partially as in the original example. And of course, if he follows the top-down",

The bottom-up approach . There may be frequent occasions when you find that your thinking is not fully enough developed to work out the top part of the pyramid. Perhaps you can't decide precisely what your Subject is, or the Question isn't clear to you, or you can't sort out what the reader does and doesn't know for sure. In such cases, simply move down to the Key Line level. If you can think of any Key Line points, fine; but often you won't be able to. Do not despair.

Date: August 22, 2001 Subject: nw As we already knew composing costs are the most important part in all new settings rang­ ing from 40 percent in Hardbacks to 50-55 percent in Paperbacks. The most important elements in composing costs are: Machine composition Reading First proof and revise Make up Imposition and plate laying 30-50% 17-25% 10-16% 10-20% 10-15% A comparison with PAR standards shows that nw has a relatively low productivity in com­ posing. At the moment the composing estimators are working on some specific examples I have given to them. Every job in composing goes through the same steps basically to ensure a high level of qual­ ity. This may explain partly why they are considered uncompetitive for composing simple jobs. There is a good deal of interest in Aylesbury in finding out what are the facts behind their composing costs. I have spoken about it with Roy Walter, Brian Thompson and George Kennedy. Kennedy is willing to set up an experiment in order to find out: (1) if there are any steps in the composing process that can be eliminated, particulary for certain jobs, and (2) what are the causes behind the apparent low productivity- i.e., why do",

Most of the jobs run behind schedule in the department. The present undercapacity is particularly acute in hand composition. nw is paying lower wages than other printers in the area and it is becoming hard to get and retain compositors. At the moment, they are faced with a new union demand. Also two compositors just left. The department has less people than budgeted and their overtime hours exceed budget by more then 50 percent. CONCLUSIONS 1. It seems feasible to reduce composing costs by: a. Simplifying the process for cheap jobs. b. Increasing productivity by changing methods. 2. In order to carry out the first one it would be necessary to do some experiments on specific jobs, following them throughout the whole process, and controlling the marginal effect on quality of changes in the number and timing of checks, and the customer's reaction to them. The savings involved could be up to 10 percent of total composing costs. The second way of reducing costs requires, I believe, detailed methods study. nw ranks 20-50 percent below PAR in setting and hand composition and it seems it would be possi­ ble to do better than that. 3. A comparison between nw and Baird, Purnell or Waterlow may throw some light on this. George Kennedy and Roy Walter seemed to be very interested in carrying out the compari­ son. I have told them it may not be very meaningful after all. 4. The attitudes with respect to composing costs in Aylesbury are mixed. Gerry Calvert feels that they are definitely high, George Kennedy claims that there is no hard evidence that they are and Roy Walter recognizes that for him they are a mystery. They all seem very willing to investigate them. I 31 === Page 44 === 32 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE by a young consultant to his engagement manager after 2 weeks of work­ ing on his first assignment.

This analysis reveals two separate lines of reasoning, with the possibility that some points that should be made have been omitted. Now you're ready to draw some conclusions. Either he's saying that the costs are high because the productivity is low and the overtime is high, or he's saying that to cut the costs you have to simplify the methods and raise the wages. To decide which, you want to think through the introduction. What does the original memo indicate the reader already knows? Apparently he knows that costs are important, that TTW is uncompeti­ tive in its pricing of simple jobs, and probably that nobody at TTW knows whether the costs are too high or not. In that case, your thinking might go something like this: 1 Subject composing room costs. 2 Question are they too high? 3 Answer yes. 4 Situation composing room costs are the most important element in total cost. 5 Complication don't know if they are too high a proportion, but uncompetitiveness indicates they",

You may not agree with the young consultant's reasoning, but at least it is presented so clearly that the reader can deter­ mine whether he agrees with it or finds things to question about it. I have reprinted the memorandum in full here because I want to demonstrate that the total introduction includes a statement of the Key Line points. With these included, the reader can get your entire thinking in the first 30 seconds or less of reading. And since the rest of the document exists only to explain or defend what you have already stated, he can be confident that no important points are going to jump up and surprise him later on. Consequently, he can scan if he has limited time available.

As we already knew, composing costs represent 40 per­ cent of hardback costs, and 50-55 percent of paperbacks. TTW does not know whether these costs are too high, but the company is considered uncompetitive for simple jobs. Our preliminary investigation indicates that composing costs could prob­ ably be cut considerably by: .. Eliminating unnecessary steps in the composing process • Raising wages to competitive levels. ELIMINATING STEPS TTW ranks 20-50 percent below PAR standards in setting and hand compo­ sition. A look at composing methods shows that every job goes through basically the same steps to ensure high quality, whether it is a Bible or a thriller. This may explain partly why they are considered uncompetitive. I have discussed these findings with Roy Walter, Brian Thompson, and George Kennedy. Kennedy is willing to set up an experiment to learn (1) whether any steps in the process can be eliminated, particularly for simple jobs, and (2) the causes of the low PAR standing. Beginning",

The savings involved could be up to 10 percent of total composing costs. We will also carry out a detailed methods study to try to close the PAR gap. RAISING WAGES TTW pays lower wages than other printers in the area, and is finding it dif­ ficult to get and retain compositors. Two compositors just quit, leaving the department with fewer people than budgeted. As a result, most jobs are running behind schedule, and overtime hours exceed budget by more than 50 percent. The company presently faces a new union demand, which may force them into higher wages. If so, they should be able to hire appropriate people and eliminate the overtime charges.

To this end, you want to take some care in the way you word the headings (see Chapter 6, How to Highlight the Structure), making sure to state them so that they reflect ideas, rather than categories.

Following are the answers to some of the most commonly asked questions from beginning users of the pyramid. 1 Always try top down first.

The chances are you'll love it once you see it typed, no matter how disjointed the thinking really is. 2 Use the Situation as the starting point for thinking through the introduction. Once you know what you want to say in the bulk of the introduction-Situation, Complication, Question, and Answer-you can place these elements in any order you like as you write, depending on the effect you want to create. The order you choose affects the tone of the document, and you will no doubt want to vary it for different kinds of documents. Nevertheless, begin your thinking with the Situation, since you're more likely to be able to think up the correct Complication and Question following that order. 3 Don't omit to think through the introduction. Very often you'll sit down to write and have the main point fully stated in your head, from which the Question is obvious. The tendency then is to jump directly down to the Key Line and begin answering the New Question raised by the statement of the main point. Don't be tempted. In most cases, you will find that you end up structuring 35 === Page 48 === 36 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE information that properly belongs in the Situation or Complication, and therefore forcing yourself into a complicated and unwieldy deductive argument. Sort out the introductory information first so that you leave yourself free to concentrate solely on ideas at the lower levels. 4 Always put historical chronology in the introduction. You cannot tell the reader 'what happened' in the body of the document, in an effort to let him know the facts. The body can contain only ideas, and ideas can relate to each other only logically. This means that you can talk about events only if you are spelling out cause-and­ effect relationships, since these had to be discovered through analytical thinking. Simple historical occurrences do not exist as the result of logical thought, and therefore cannot be included as ideas. 5 Limit the introduction to what the reader will agree is true. The introduction is meant to tell the reader only what he already knows. Sometimes, of course, you won't know whether he actually knows something; at other times, you may be certain that indeed he does not know it. If the point being made can",

An idea has to be supported until you have answered all the questions likely to be raised by it. Naturally, not every point needs the same depth of support. At the Key Line level, however, all points must have at least one level of support. This is particularly true of the 'therefore' point in a deductive argument. If you find yourself with no need to support the final point, then you have overstructured your argument and probably need only an inductive grouping. === Page 49 === - Fine points of introductions As we saw in How to Build a Pyramid Structure, thinking through the intro­ duction is the key step in discovering the ideas that must be presented in a document. By summarizing what the reader already knows, the introduc­ tion establishes the relevance of the question to which your document will give him the answer. You can then devote your energies to answering it. However, actually finding the structure of the introduction can be a rel­ atively complex and time-consuming activity. To this end, you may want a more comprehensive understanding of the theory and nature of initial introductions than was given earlier. You will also want some insight into the nature of the introductory comments needed at each of the key struc­ tural points in the body of the document. Initial introductions . . . . . The 1n1t1al 1ntroduct1on can be thought of as a circle around the top of your pyramid, outside the structure of the ideas you are presenting (Exhibit 10). It always tells the reader a story he already knows, in the sense that it states the Situation within which a Complication developed that raised the Question to which the document is giving the Answer. Why does it always have to be a story, and why one that he already knows? Why a story? If you think about it for a moment, you can accept that nobody really wants to read what you've written the way he really wants to read a novel that everyone has assured him is both gripping and sexy.

He will be pleased to make that effort only if there is a com­ pelling enticement for him to do so. Even if he is quite eager to know what your document contains, and convinced of its interest, he must still make the effort to push aside his other thoughts and concentrate on what you're saying. All of us have had the experience of reading a page and a half of something and suddenly realizing that we haven't comprehended a word. It's because we didn't push aside what was already in our heads. Consequently, you want to offer the reader a device that will make it easy for him to push his other thoughts aside and concentrate only on what you're saying. A foolproof device of this sort is the lure of an unfin­ ished story. For example, suppose I say to you: 'Two Irishmen met on a bridge at midnight in a strange city .. ' I have your interest actively engaged for the moment, despite whatever else you may have been thinking about before you read the words. I have riveted your mind to a specific time and place, and I can effectively control where it goes by focusing it on what the two Irishmen said or did, releas­ ing it only when I give the punch line. That's what you want to do in an introduction. You want to build on the reader's interest in the subject by telling him a story about it. Every good story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. That is, it establishes a situation, introduces a complication, and offers a resolution. The resolution will always be your major point, since you always write either to resolve a problem or to answer a question already in the reader's mind. But the story has also got to be a 'good' story for the reader. If you have any children you",

Consequently, if you want to tell the reader a really good story, you tell him one he already knows or could reasonably be expected to know if he's at all well informed. Psychologically speaking, of course, this approach enables you to tell him things with which you know he will agree, prior to your telling him things with which he may disagree. Easy reading of agreeable points is apt to render him more receptive to your ideas than confused plodding through a morass of detail. How long should it be? How long should an introduction be? How long should a man's legs be? (Long enough to reach the ground.) The introduction should be long enough to ensure that you and the reader are 'standing in the same place' before you take him by the hand and lead him through your thinking. 39 === Page 52 === 40 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Generally, this means two or three paragraphs, arranged as shown in Exhibit 11. The Situation and the Complication can each be as long as three or four paragraphs, but never more than that. It can't take very much to remind someone of what he already knows. Indeed, if you find yourself littering the introduction with exhibits, you can be sure that you are overstating the obvious. By contrast, the introduction can also be as short as a sentence: 'In your letter of January 15 you asked me whether ... ' The closer you are in your everyday dealings to the person to whom you are writing, the shorter the introduction can get. But it must say enough to remind the reader of his Question. Where do you start the situation? You begin writing the Situation by making a statement about the subject that you know the reader will agree with because you are telling him something that he already knows. If you find you can't make a statement about the subject, then either you have the wrong subject, or you're start­ ing in the wrong place to talk about it.

You start at the point where you can make a self-sufficient and noncon­ troversial statement about the subject -self-sufficient in the sense that no previous statement is needed to make the precise meaning of this one clear, and noncontroversial in the sense that you can expect him automat­ ically to understand it and agree to it. If you are writing a report for wide circulation, however, or a magazine article or a book, the job is not so much to remind the reader of the ques­ tion as to plant one. Here getting started is a bit more difficult. Assume that your readers are moderately well informed, and present an explana­ tion of what is already generally accepted knowledge on the subject. By arranging known material in a narrative form, and usually in a way that they haven't thought about it before, you inspire your readers to ask the question you wish to address. The key characteristic of all opening Situation sentences is that they leave you expectant for further information -and that is what qualifies them to be openers. Each one establishes the base for a story to come. Here are some typical Situation opening sentences: • Energoinvest is considering the possibility of exporting alumina from its Mostar plant to Ziar in Czechoslovakia. (Memorandum.) • Every major health service is beset by increasing pressure on already scarce resources -and the Irish Health Service is no exception. (Report.) e If we accept the common usage of words, nothing can be more readily disproved than the old saw, 'You can't keep a good man down.' (Book.) What's a complication? The Complication of the introduction is not a complication in the everyday sense of the word; it is the Complication to the story. It describes an alter­ ation to a stable situation, rather than a problem per se, although sometimes the alteration is a problem. Exhibit 12 shows several possible kinds of complications. 41 === Page 54 === 42 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Exhibit 12 The Complication states an alteration to the Situation SITUATION COMPLICATION QUESTION Recognized Something went wrong What do we do? stable Situation Something could go wrong How can we prevent it?

Setting the points out enables the reader to get your entire thinking in the first 30 seconds or so of reading. Since anything that follows will serve only to explain or defend these points, you have courteously put the reader in the position of being able to determine whether he needs to go on or is ready to accept your conclusions as they stand. In any case, he now knows what to expect and can read with a greater sense of ease. If the document is a short one, with only a paragraph or two to support each section, you do not of course want to set out the points and then repeat them in headings. In such cases, use the points as topic sentences to your paragraphs and underline them so that they jump out at the reader. Remember that the Key Line points should be expressed as ideas. It is not sufficient, for example, to write an introduction like the following: This memorandurn describes. the projectteam approach to identifying and achieving significant profit improvements; It is organized in six sections as follows: Bcickground Principles of project team approach Whatproject work is How the program is organized Unique.benefits and specific results Prerequisites for.success. Here the setout of the points is useless in the sense of conveying the mes­ sage of the document to the reader. It simply forces on the reader a string of words that he can't put into perspective -mere excess baggage that wastes his time and delays his understanding. As a rule of thumb, you never want to have a section labelled 'Background' (or 'Introduction') because the major point it expresses will not be on the same level of abstraction as the other points that follow. In the example above, of course, because the writer is writing about subjects instead of about ideas, the ideas likely to be behind the subjects will prob­ ably not form a clear argument, either inductive or deductive. Indeed, one suspects that the ideas in the various sections are badly jumbled as they stand. For example, the 'Unique benefits and specific results' should probably be discussed under the 'Principles of project team approach,' and the 'Prerequisites for success' probably belong under 'How the program is organized.'

Rather, it is related to the needs of the reader. What does he have to be told not only to com­ prehend fully the significance of your main point, but also to want to read on to learn how you arrived at it? In summary I hope this discussion of opening introductions has made you think that it is important to devote a good deal of thought to ensuring that you write a good introduction. For as you can gather from the examples, a good introduction does more than simply gain and hold the reader's interest. It influences his perceptions. The narrative flow lends a feeling of plausibility to the writer's particu­ lar interpretation of the situation, which by its nature must be a biased selection of the relevant details; and this feeling of plausibility constricts the reader's ability to interpret the situation differently. It also gives a sense of inevitable rightness to the logic of the writer's conclusion, making the reader less inclined to argue with the thinking that follows. Finally, it estab­ lishes the writer's attitude to the reader as a considerate one of wanting him clearly to understand the situation -to see behind the language to the reality it represents. To emphasize the theory behind writing good introductions: 1 Introductions are meant to remind rather than to inform. This means that nothing should be included that would have to be proved to the reader for him to accept the statements of your points -i.e., no exhibits. 2 They should always contain the three elements of a story. These are the Situation, the Complication, and the Solution. And in longer documents you will want to add an explanation of what is to come. The first three elements need not always be placed in classic narrative order, but they do always need to be included, and they should be woven into story form. 3 The length of the introduction depends on the needs of the reader and the demands of the subject. Thus, there is",

All these items can and should be woven into the story, however. 49 === Page 62 === 50 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Some common patterns As time goes on and you find yourself thinking through the introductions to a variety of documents, you will notice some common patterns begin to emerge. Which patterns will become common for you will, of course, depend on the business you are in. But to show you what I mean, here are the five patterns I have seen repeated most often, drawn from both business and consulting. They are: 1 Directives 2 Requests for funds 3 'How to' documents 4 Letters of Proposal 5 Progress Reviews Directives This must be the most common kind of business memorandum written anywhere in the world -reflecting a situation in which you are writing to tell someone else to do something. In this case, you will be planting the question in the reader's mind, rather than reminding him of it. To illustrate, suppose you are holding a meeting for your field salesmen, at which you are planning to teach them how to present a new selling technique to chain grocery stores. However, in order to do so effectively you need some information from them on a particular problem chain in their local area. How would you structure the introduction? Very much in this manner: S = At the field sales meeting we want to teach you how to present the Space Management Program C = Need a profile of a problem chain in your area Q = (How do I prepare the profile?) Or, to put it as starkly as possible: S = We want to do X C = We need you to do Y Q = How do I do Y? In this case the question would be implied rather than stated, since the flow of the writing would not require it to be spelled out. Nevertheless, it is absolutely essential that you spell it out for yourself before you begin to write. Otherwise, you run the danger of not being absolutely sure of your question. === Page 63 === FINE POINTS OF INTRODUCTIONS In this example, the question",

Whenever the question is 'How?' the answer is inevitably 'steps,' so that you would end up with a structure something like that shown in Exhibit 14. Note also that the Complication and the Answer are reversals of each other, since the Answer is the effect of carrying out the actions, which of course would solve the problem. To try another example, suppose you have a procedures manual that various people in the company update or add to, and you want to make sure they all do it in the same way: S = We have a manual covering activities where nonconformity of action would be detrimental. From time to time needs updating. C = To ensure compatibility, important to follow the same procedure. Q = (What is the procedure?) And again you have another question that would be implied rather than stated in writing. To show the pattern starkly: S = You do X C = Must do in Y way Q = What is Y way? Requests for funds Another very common memorandum type is one requesting funds. For Exhibit 14 Field Sales Meeting How? Select a suitable chain by July 11 Criteria? Profile a problem chain Collect necessary data by August 10 · What data? S = We want to teach you to give presentation C = Need profile of a problem chain from each region Q = How do I prepare the profile? Organize and return data by August 15 ;: In what form? 51 === Page 64 === 52 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE those the reader's Question is always 'Should I approve the request?' and here again the Question would be implied rather than stated, as would the Complication. That is, you would have a formal structure that said: S The Consumer Group wishes to purchase a Wang System 25 II, together with four CRTs and three printers, at a cost of $_. C (They cannot purchase without your approval) Q == (Should I approve?) Only the Situation would be stated in the writing, and then the pyramid structure would tell the reader to approve the purchase for some set of rel­ evant reasons. For example: We should approve this request because: The cost will be more than offset by the projected savings It will greatly increase the Group's productivity It will create new opportunities for service.

The structure of any 'how to' document is 'steps,' as shown below: Q = How? How? Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 However, the introductory structure varies slightly depending on whether you are telling the reader how to do something he has not done before or whether you are telling him how to do properly what he is already doing. The memorandum on The Role of the Board shown on page 19 in Chapter 2 is an example of the first type: S == Must do X activity C == Not set up to do so Q == How do we get set up? === Page 65 === FINE POINTS OF INTRODUCTIONS By contrast, suppose you have a company whose market forecasting system gives inaccurate forecasts, and they want you to tell them how to make it give accurate ones. The structure is always: S = Your present system is X C = It doesn't work properly Q = How change to make it work properly? The trick here is to begin your thinking by literally laying out the present process as they do it now. (See Exhibit 15.) Then lay out the process as you think it should be done. The differences between the first structure and the second tell you what the steps on your Key Line must be.

You may assume that you know pre­ cisely what they are, having been working on them for so long. But unless you lay them out and compare them, the chances of leaving something important out are very great. You cannot be sure your thinking is complete and that you have not",

I have seen many examples of incomplete thinking in this area that I make a special point of mentioning it. Indeed, we had an example in the Big Chief memo in Chapter 3. Letters of proposal These documents are the lifeblood of consulting, and have thus had a good deal of thought lavished on them over the years by consulting firms. Most firms follow this approach: S = You have a problem C = You have decided to bring in an outsider to solve it Q = (Are you the outsider we should hire to solve it?) The Answer to the Question is always 'yes,' of course, followed by a 3-part structure explaining that: 1 We understand the problem 2 We have a sound approach for solving it 3 We have good people to work on it. This is perfectly logical in concept. However, let me point out that, struc­ turally, the only section that reflects thinking is the approach section. The first section is an extended description of the Situation, playing back to the reader in organized form everything he has told you about how the prob­ lem arose. Similarly, the final section, while true, is simply a listing of the qualifications of the people who will be assigned to the team. The major thinking is done in the approach section, where you specify the steps you will take (never more than 5) to solve the problem. These steps must be stated in end-product terms as explained in Chapter 9, and will serve to define the major phases of the study, with the specific end products to be expected at the end of each phase. It is on the basis of the approach that the client should make his decision to hire, although alas that is not always the case. === Page 67 === FINE POINTS OF INTRODUCTIONS Progress reviews Finally we come to Progress Reviews. These are usually the formal com­ munications one schedules with the client at the end of each phase of the study, leading up to the final report. After the first one, the structure is always the same. The first one will say something like this: S You people have X problem. C We told you in our Letter of Proposal that we would do Y first to solve it. We have now",

Perhaps he will ask you to investigate an anomaly you have uncovered in your work. Or he may approve what you've done and tell you to move on to phase two. At the time of your next progress review, then, you might say something like this: S In our last progress review we told you that you had a capacity problem C You said you thought this would not be a problem long because you believed your competition was shortly going out of business. You asked us to investigate whether that were the case. We have now completed our investigation. Q = (What did you find?) A = We found that you will still have a capacity problem, only worse. Or to put it in skeletal form: S = We told you X C = You asked us to investigate Y, which we have done Q = What did you find? What must be apparent by now from these examples is that the pivot on which your entire document depends is the Question, of which there is always only one to a document. If you have two, they must be related: 'Should we enter the market, and if so, how?' is really 'How should we enter the market?' since if the answer to the first question is no, the second question is not dealt with. On occasion you will not be able to determine the question easily just by thinking through the introduction. In that case, look at the material you intend to include in the body. Whenever you have a set of points you want to make, you want to make them because you think the reader should know them. Why should he know them? Only because they answer a 55 === Page 68 === 56 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE question. Why would that question have arisen? Because of his situation. So that by working backward you can invent a plausible introduction to give your question a logical provenance.

Thus, you do not want to say such things as: This chapter haslooked atthe need for priorities. The next chapter looks at how these priorities should be s.et. In other words, you do not want to relate what two chapters or sections do, you want to relate what they say -their major ideas. And you want to do it in such a way that you seem to be looking in two directions at once -back to what has been said and forward to what is to be said. If you make this pause at the beginning of a chapter, section, or subsection, you should use the technique of referencing backward. If the chapters or sec­ tions are long ones, then you will probably find it clearer to pause at the end and make a summary before going on. Referencing backward The technique of referencing backward consists simply of picking up a word or a phrase or the main idea of the preceding portion of the pyramid that you are linking, and using it in your opening sentence. You are probably familiar with the technique in transitions between paragraphs.

Board and Chairman, a Group Managing Director, and three key executives reporting to him, each in charge of one of the Group's major businesses. These positions and reporting relationships provide a strong framework for long­ term leadership and control of Groupwide operations. Only by streamlining the structure to provide this degree of control and accountability can the Group realize the improvement of opportunities identified elsewhere in this report. Concluding summaries of this sort are not difficult to write if you keep in mind that they are meant to restate, as adroitly as possible, the principal matter and tone of the preceding text. Since you have these in front of you in your pyra­ mid, all you are doing is pulling them together again for the reader. In all of this positioning, the intention is to make the job of thinking required of the reader as easy as possible. He is, after all, rarely trained in analysis and reflection, and can have nowhere near the understanding of the subject you have even if the subject is his own company. You and he are not peers in interpreting your thinking on the subject. Thus, you must expect that his mind will not be precisely where you want it to be, in terms of understanding, as you finish one lengthy group of points and prepare to go on to the next. Your transitions are meant to grab his mind, as it were, and pull it back to where it belongs if he is to comprehend what you are trying to say. This is essentially an exercise in good manners, provided it is done gracefully and only where needed. Concluding Theoretically, if you write a proper introduction and structure the body of your document to obey the pyramid rules, you should not need a con­ cluding statement. You have, after all, clearly stated your reader's question at the beginning, and answered it fully with impeccable logic. 59 === Page 72 === 60 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Nevertheless, you may feel a psychological need to end gracefully rather than simply to stop writing. The tendency to end short memos by saying, 'If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to call,' no doubt reflects this need. The obvious, perhaps too obvious, procedure at the end of a longer doc­ ument is to signal the end by",

You then begin your last para­ graph with the words, 'In conclusion ... ' and re-emphasize your main point. However, if you favour this approach you want to avoid merely making a lame restatement of what you have already made abundantly clear: Thi~ reporthas·.outli.ned .ourreC:omrnendatfons for reorganizing th~· c~mpany:a~dspell~d out the spedfic st~p~ each. department rptjst • · take to bring it about.' · . · . . . ·· . Rather, you want to find a compelling set of words that not only sums up for the reader what you have been saying, but also produces an appropri­ ate emotion in him about it. At least, that is Aristotle's advice about what to do in a conclusion. That there is an 'appropriate emotion' for the end of a business docu­ ment may be open to question, but I should think the major feeling you want to leave with your reader is that of a need and desire to act. Consequently, you want to give him some indication of what he is to think about or is able to do with the new knowledge he now possesses as a result of his reading. This can take the form of either a philosophical insight or a prescription for immediate action. Abraham Lincoln, in his second inaugural address, managed to do both: 'With malice towards none>witb charity for all, withfirmness .in the · right, as God .gives us to see.the right, let us strive ol) to. finish the . · . work we are in.-to bindup the nc1tion'5;wounds \"'-to care fot:him who shall h9ve bornethe ba~le, and for his w(dow an? his orphan -to do all which may achieve and cherish a justaqd fasting peace . among ourselves and with. all nations,' You will, of course, want to be as subtle and restrained as your subject and your reader demand, so that what is an appropriate ending will vary with each. An airline president, for example, would probably be offended by strongly emotional statements when being urged to adopt a new planning system. But on a subject on which he already feels === Page 73 === FINE POINTS OF INTRODUCTIONS strongly, such as deregulation of his industry, he would surely be wide open to emotional appeals.

Here, for example, is the concluding paragraph of a report whose message was that it is technically possible to create a European­ wide system for rapid retrieval by computer of technical literature. 'If you succeed in launching the system, you will not just have created the means for improved access to scientific and technical information in Europe by users in industry, commerce, the professions, and academia. You will also have created a common market for information, one that makes available the full range of existing sources, not just national collections, to all users. This could lead not only to advances in standardization and harmonization, but also to the development of totally new standards. We find the prospect exciting, and are eager to work with you in launching the pilot project.' As you may have gathered from my tone, I do not encourage most people to write concluding paragraphs because they are so difficult to do well. Simple pragmatism dictates that you do without. However, there is an occasion on which you will definitely need a concluding section, and that is when you are dealing with future actions. Sometimes you will write a very long document that recommends a course of action that you think the reader is likely to take. If he takes it, there are some things he ought to do Monday morning to get things in motion. To house these activities, you create a section called Next Steps. The only rule is that what you put in this section must be something that the reader will not question. That is, activities must be logically obvious ones. For example, suppose you are recommending that the client buy a com­ pany, and you think that he is going to do so. After 30 pages of explaining why you think it is a good idea, you assume you have him convinced. You then title your next section Next Steps, and say something like, 'If you think this is a good buy then you should: • Call the man who owns it and ask him to lunch. \" Call the bank to make sure the money for purchase will be available when you need it. • Reconvene the Acquisitions Committee to handle the administrative details. 61 === Page 74 === 62 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Clearly, your",

These are self-evident points, and can be accepted without demur. If, on the other hand, they were points that did raise questions in his mind, then you would have to include them in the body of your text, and make certain they fit horizontally and vertically with everything else you're saying. === Page 75 === Deduction and induction: the difference As we have demonstrated, clear writing results from a clear exposition of the exact relationships between a group of ideas on the same subject. Properly organized, these ideas will always form a pyramid, with the vari­ ous levels of abstraction sorted out and related under a single thought. Ideas in the pyramid relate in three ways -up, down, and sideways. An idea above a grouping summarizes the ideas below, while these ideas in turn explain or defend the point above. At the same time, the ideas in the grouping march sideways in logical order. What constitutes logical order differs depending on whether the pyramided group was formed deduc­ tively or inductively. These two forms of reasoning are the only patterns available for estab­ lishing logical relationships between ideas. Consequently, an understanding of how they differ and what their rules are is essential to being able to sort out your thinking and express it clearly in writing. Briefly, the difference is as shown in Exhibit 17. Deduction presents a line of reasoning that leads to a 'therefore' conclusion, and the point above is a summary of that line of reasoning, resting heavily on the final point. Induction defines a group of facts or ideas to be the same kind of thing, and then makes a statement (or inference) about that sameness. The deductive points derive from each other; the inductive points do not. These differences are really quite enormous, as the next two sections will demonstrate. Once you have digested them, you should have little difficulty in recognizing or sorting out either form of reasoning, or in choosing the one that appropriately permits you to say clearly what you mean. Deductive reasoning . . Deductive reasoning appears to be the pattern the mind generally prefers to use in most of its thinking, possibly because it is easier to construct than inductive reasoning.

But while it is a useful way to think, it is a ponderous way to write, as I shall hope to show. How it works First, let's understand what deductive reasoning is. It is usually described as taking the form of a syllogism -an argument in which a conclusion is inferred from two premises, one major and one minor. I find these terms confusing in explaining how deductive thinking works in writing, and so I will not use them again. Instead, think of a deductive argument as needing to do three things: • Make a statement about a situation that exists in the world. \" Make another statement about a related situation that exists in the world at the same time. The second statement relates to the first if it comments on either its subject or its predicate. • State the implication of these two situations existing in the world at the same time. Exhibit 18 shows several deductive arguments, each of which can be seen to do precisely these three things. And in each case the point at the top should roughly summarize the ideas grouped below, resting heavily on the final point. Thus, 'Because Socrates is a man he is mortal,' or 'Since the === Page 77 === DEDUCTION AND INDUCTION: THE DIFFERENCE Exhibit 18 Examples of deductive arguments Men are mortal Socrates is a man Therefore Socrates is mortal The purpose of The union monopoly Therefore ' the monopolies law is -over manpower -the unions should be to stimulate production stops production controlled by the and distribution and distribution monoplies law Any company that meets I Company A I Therefore i these three criteria will be worth buying meets all three criteria Company A is worth buying I Volume increases Your present structure Therefore I:' makes it impossible ~ you should correct as a result of doing -for you to do any of your present",

These are examples of deductive arguments in which each step of the reasoning has been included. But sometimes you will find yourself wanting to skip a step and chain two or more deductive arguments together, since to put in every step would take too long and sound pedantic. This chaining of arguments is perfectly permissible, provided that your reader is likely to grasp and agree with the missing steps. Exhibit 19 gives an example of a chained deductive argument that should probably go something like this: We produce enough used newspaper to meet our own demand. But we have done more than meet our own demand. Therefore we have a shortage. A shortage of used newspaper causes a shortage of newsprint. We have a shortage of used newspaper. Therefore we have a shortage ofnewsprint. 65 === Page 78 === 66 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Exhibit 19 Examples of a chained deductive argument Continued selling of used newspaper ' to Asian countries could aggravate the already short supply of newsprint in Southern California \\ The supply of used However, Southern This shortage of raw newspaper in Southern California sales to Asian ' material will aggravate California is adequate ----+ countries have caused ~ the already short supply to meet demand there a serve shortage that of newsprint in now and in the future will persist Southern California You can see how boring this argument would be to read if you put in every step, and in general that is my major complaint about the use of deductive arguments in writing. They are boring, primarily because they make a mystery story out of what should be a straightforward point. When to use it This leads me to urge that, on the Key Line level, you try to avoid using a deductive argument, and strive instead always to present your message inductively. Why? Because it is easier on the reader. Let's look",

Suppose you wish to tell him that he must change in some way. Your argument would look something like this: Why? Here's what is A1 81 C1 A2 You must change 82 C2 Therefore, here's what you should do about it A3 83 C3 To absorb your reasoning, the reader must first take in and hold the A­ B-Cs of what is going wrong. I agree this is not a difficult task, but then you ask him to take the first A of what is going wrong, bring it over and === Page 79 === DEDUCTION AND INDUCTION: THE DIFFERENCE relate it to the second A of what is causing it, and then hold that in his head while you make the same match for the Bs and Cs. Next you ask him to repeat the process, this time tying the first A of what is going wrong to the second A of what is causing it, and hauling the whole cartload to hitch to the third A of what to do about it. And the same with the Bs and Cs. Not only do you make the reader wait a very long time to find out what he should do Monday morning, you also force him to re-enact your entire problem-solving process before he receives his reward. It is almost as if you're saying to him, 'I worked extremely hard to get this answer, and I'm going to make sure you know it.' How much easier on everybody were you simply to present the same message inductively: How? A2 A1 B2 B1 C2 C1 Here, instead of answering the 'Why?' question first and the 'How?' ques­ tion second, you simply reverse the order. And now, while you may indeed have deductive arguments at the lower levels, still you have answered the reader's major question directly, with clear fences in your thinking between subject areas, and all information on each subject in one place. To explain it another way, at the end of the problem-solving process, yo,u will have come up with a set of ideas that can be sorted onto a Recommendation Worksheet like that shown in Exhibit 20.

In writing to recommend action, you will never give findings that do not lead to conclusions, nor state conclusions that are not based on findings. (The conclusions are, in fact, the findings at a higher level of abstraction.) Nor will you have conclusions that do not lead to recommendations, nor recommendations that are not based on conclusions. (One conclusion can lead to several recommendations, and several conclusions can lead to one recommendation, but there must always be a connection.) The conclusions generally state the problem that the recommenda­ tions solve. Consequently, the effect of the recommendation is to solve the problem you concluded was there. For example, sales are off 40 per­ cent (finding) because our competitor added a new device to his product 67 === Page 80 === 68 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Exhibit 20 FINDINGS CONCLUSIONS RECOMMENDATIONS Sales are off 40% Competitive change Make similar change ----has cost us 40% ->-in our product Competitor has added new device Nothing else has changed of sales (conclusion as to why sales are off), so you recommend that we add a similar device to ours. The effect of the recommendation is to make our product competitive. Now, you can present this message deductively, one column at a time, in effect: • Sales are off 40%. • They are off because of competitive changes. • Therefore, I recommend we make similar changes. Or you can simply turn the whole thing 90 degrees to the left and begin with the recommendation: We must redesign to regain position Competition has done so Has resulted in a 40% loss of our market share. The issue here is whether it is better to tell the reader why he should change and then how to go about it, or that he should change and why. As a rule of thumb, it is always better to present the action before the argument, since that is what the reader cares about, unless you face one of those rare cases in which it is the argument he really cares about. I can think of only two situations in which the argument might be more impor­ tant to the reader than the action: • If he is going to disagree strongly with your conclusion, so you must prepare him to accept it. • If he is incapable of understanding the action without prior explanation (as in a paper on how to",

Note that I am talking only about the Key Line here, and not about lower levels. Deductive arguments are very easy to absorb if they reach you directly: Birds fly I am a bird Therefore, I fly When, however, you must plough through 10 or 12 pages between the first point and the second, and between the second and the third, then they lose their instant clarity. Consequently, you want to push deductive reasoning as low in the pyramid as possible, to limit intervening informa­ tion to the minimum. At the paragraph level deductive arguments are lovely, and present an easy-to-follow flow. But inductive reasoning is always easier to absorb at higher levels. Inductive reasoning 1 d . . . h d'ff' n uct1ve reasoning 1s muc more 1 1- cult to do well than is deductive reasoning, since it is a more creative activity. In inductive reasoning the mind notices that several different things (ideas, events, facts) are similar in some way, brings them together in a group, and comments on the significance of their similarity. In the example of the Polish tanks cited in Exhibit 17, the events were all defined as warlike movements against Poland. Hence, the inference that Poland was about to be invaded. If, however, the events had been defined as preparations by Poland's allies to attack the rest of Europe, a quite different inference would have been in order. This brings us to the two major skills one must develop to think cre­ atively in the inductive form: • Defining the ideas in the grouping • Identifying the misfits among them. How to do both things with precision is explained in considerable detail in Chapter 7. But at this point you need only understand the rudiments of how it is done to be able to distinguish the process from deduction. 69 === Page 82 === 70 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE How it works The key technique is to find one word that describes the kind of ideas in your grouping. This word will always be a plural noun",

'Warlike movements' is a plural noun in this sense, and so is 'preparations for attack.' If you look at the inductive groupings in Exhibit 21, you will easily be able to see that each one can be described by a plural noun: schemes, Exhibit 21 Clear inductive arguments To found a city in which Maupertuis was an ingenious man, but not a man of strong practical sense, as evidenced by the schemes he was incessantly devising To dig a deep To institute hole in the earth psychological To explain the formation of only Latin to find investigation by the embryo by should be spoken Create smaller, more highly skilled work forces Could upset your testamentary scheme new substances means of opium gravitation Eliminate wasted effort in on-site activities Deploy the work forces to accommodate work availability Joint property sets you or your family up to be hurt in the future Could increase estate taxes Could create liability for gift taxes Ensure delivery of relevant information on work availability to the sites Could complicate a divorce settlement === Page 83 === DEDUCTION AND INDUCTION: THE DIFFERENCE steps, ways of hurting. And in each case again you can see that none of the ideas in any of the three groupings is a misfit; each one matches the description of the plural noun. The next step is always to check your reasoning, and this is done by questioning from the bottom up. For example, if you see a man who wants to found a city in which only Latin should be spoken, dig a deep hole in the center of the earth, etc., can you infer that this is an ingenious man, but not a man of strong practical sense? Yes, you can, or at least you could when the statement was originally written. By contrast, consider the two examples in Exhibit 22. If you see man­ agers who don't face reality, won't countenance criticism, etc., can you infer that they mismanage because they want to? Certainly not, it's sloppy reasoning and writing. What about the next one? If productivity is low, overtime high, and prices uncompetitive, can you infer that you have a profit-improvement opportunity? Perhaps, but I can think of three or",

In that case, you know the overall point is at too high a level of abstraction in relationship to the three points grouped below, since it does not make a statement specifically and only about them. Exhibit 22 Poor inductive arguments Don't face reality Won't counte­ nance internal criticism Productivity low Won't cut off losing activities Composing room costs may represent a profit-improvement opportunity Overtime high Prices uncompetitive for simple jobs 71 === Page 84 === 72 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE In fact, however, this is really a deductive argument masquerading as an inductive one, as you may have remembered from the example in Chapter 3. The low productivity led to the high overtime, which led to uncompeti­ tive prices. Whenever you have only one piece of evidence for anything, you are forced to deal with it deductively. Thus, the point implied at the top is something like 'Our prices are high because our productivity is low.' How it differs I'm sure you can see now how very different deduction and induction are, and how easily you can tell the difference. Remember, if you are thinking deductively, your second point will always comment on the subject or predicate of the first. If it does not so comment, you should be able to classify it by the same plural noun as the first, to test that you have a proper inductive grouping. To demonstrate, I recently ran across two so-called deductive fallacies in a logic book, which went as follows: All communistsare proponents of socialized medicine Some members of the administration are proponents of socialized medicine. Therefore some members of the administration are communists. All rabbits are very fast runners. Some horses are very fast runners. Therefore, some horses are rabbits. In both cases, I'm sure you will instantly be able to see that the second point does not make a comment on the first point, so these ideas cannot be deductively related. What the second point does do in each case is to add another member to the classification (plural noun) established in the first point. Placing ideas in classes is defining them by a plural noun, and you know that that is induction. To test yourself, suppose I say to you: o Japanese businessmen are escalating their drive for the Chinese market. Can you pick which of",

This expectation of the mind for deductive and inductive arguments to be completed often leads the reader to project his thinking ahead, to formulate what he thinks your next point will be. If his is differ­ ent from yours, he can become both confused and annoyed. Consequently, you want to make sure that he will easily recognize the direction in which your thinking is tending by giving him the top point before you state the ideas grouped below. 73 === Page 87 === How to highlight the structure Once you have worked out the logic of your pyramid and are ready to begin writing, you want to be sure you arrange your ideas on the page in a way that emphasizes the various divisions of thought.

You can reflect this hierarchy in a variety of ways, the most common of which are headings, underlined points, decimal numbering, and indented display. Feelings run high about which of these is the 'best' formatting device. I myself lean to the use of headings as described below. However, in deference to what are excellent reasons given by proponents of the others, I discuss them as well. Whichever format you choose, remember that your objective is to make comprehension easier for the reader. This means that the format must be applied properly to reflect the levels of abstraction in your argument. To give the desired appearance without the proper content can cause confusion.

Of course, the style of headings you choose need not necessarily follow this particu­ lar form, but whatever the form, each heading should represent a division of thought. Because your headings will represent divisions of thought, their use should reflect the relationships between the ideas inherent in the pyramid.

Major thought 1 Never use only one of any element. Since the headings indicate levels of abstraction in the pyramid, you can never have only one item at each level. Thus, you can never have only one major section, or one subsection, or one numbered paragraph, or one dash point. Put more plainly, you shouldn't just stick in a heading because you think it would look good on a page, the way newspapers and magazines do, to break up the printing. A heading is meant to call attention to the fact that the idea it represents is one of a group, all of which",

Since all of the ideas in a group are the same kind of idea, you want to emphasize this sameness by using the same grammatical form for the wording of each heading, etc. Consequently, if the first idea in a group of major section headings begins with a verb, all the rest must as well; if the first ·idea in a group of subsection headings begins with an 'ing' word, so should all the others: === Page 89 === HOW TO HIGHLIGHT THE STRUCTURE Appoint a full-time Chief Executive To coordinate activities To effect improvements Establish clear lines of authority Regrouping hotels by support needs Assigning responsibility for overseas operations Removing Boards from the chain of command. As you can see, because the subsection headings in the first group begin with the word 'To' does not necessarily mean that those in the second group must do so as well. Remember that there are invisible fences imposed between the ideas in each major section. Thus, the parallelism to be emphasized is between ideas in the subsection group, not between groups of subsections. 3 Limit the wording to the essence of the thought. The headings are meant to remind, not to dominate. Thus, you want to make them as concise as possible. You would not want, for example, to make the first major section heading above read 'Appoint a full-time Chief Executive to provide clear central authority.' 4 Don't regard headings as part of text. Headings are for the eye more then they are for the mind. As a result, they are not often read carefully, and you cannot depend on them to carry your message. Accordingly, you need to make sure that your opening sentence under a heading indicates that you are turning to a new topic. In fact, your entire document should be able to be read as a smooth-flowing piece without the headings. By the same token, you should never use the headings as part of the text. For example: Appoint a full-time Chief Executive This action will go far toward clarifying the day-to-day responsibilities of ...

To omit this service is to present the reader with a mystery story, since he will then not be able to judge what the point is you are trying to make in that section until he gets to the end -and by then he may well have forgotten the beginning. For 77 === Page 90 === 78 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Exhibit 24 Examples of Headings 1. THIS IS A CHAPTER HEADING Chapter headings are numbered and centered, and should be worded to reflect the major thought to be developed in the chapter. The paragraphs imme­ diately following a chapter heading (or title) should express the major idea clearly, as well as supply whatever other information the reader requires to ensure that you and he are 'standing in the same place' before you make your point and tell him how you plan to develop it. Subsequent chapter headings should be written in parallel style. C: The major divisions of thought you plan to have may be set out with para­ graph points or some other distinguishing mark: • First major thought to come. • Second major thought to come. THIS IS A SECTION HEADING The wording of section headings should also reflect the idea to be developed in the section to follow, and the wording of the first should parallel that of the others. A section can be further divided either into subsections or, if the points are short, into numbered paragraphs. The principal ideas of the subsections should be introduced and may be set off with paragraph points: • First subthought to come. • Second subthought to come. This is a Subsection Heading These, too, should be worded to reflect the principal thoughts they cover, and expressed in parallel style. If you wish further to divide the thought in a subsec­ tion, you can use numbered paragraphs. 1. This is a numbered paragraph. The first sentence or opening phrase can be underlined to highlight the similarity of the points being numbered. The point to be made may require more than one paragraph, but you should try to limit the development of the point to three paragraphs. -This is a dash-point paragraph, which is used to divide the thought in a numbered paragraph • You seldom break an idea down as far as dot-points but when",

Stars can be placed three in a row, in the center of the page, to indicate that a concluding comment to a long section is about to follow (see above). The paragraph point (I) can be used to set out lists when the number of items to be included is less than five (for example, for the section headings listed above), or to call attention to a single paragraph that contains a point to be emphasized. • These paragraphs should be written in block form, and kept as short as possible. === Page 91 === HOW TO HIGHLIGHT THE STRUCTURE this reason, you should never have a major section heading begin immediately after the title, nor should you ever have a subsection heading begin immediately after the section heading. 6 Don't overdo. This is perhaps the most important rule of all. You want to use headings only if they are going to clarify your meaning -if they are going to make it easier for the reader to keep the subdivisions of your thought in his head. Often it is not necessary or useful to have any divisions below the major section headings. If you formulate your headings properly, they will stand in the table of con­ tents as a precis of your report -another extremely useful device for the reader in trying to come to terms with your thinking. Underlined points Another popular approach is literally to show the hierarchy of ideas by underlining the entire statement of the support points below the Key Line level (Exhibit 25). Lower level support points are also stated in their entirety, but distinguished by form and indentation. The purpose of this format is to provide speed and ease in reading. The theory is that the reader should be able to speed through if he wishes, reading only the major underlined points, and in that way comprehend the entire message. You must be absolutely disciplined in applying question/answer logic. Points below must directly answer the question raised by the point above, and no more. There is no room in this format for graceful liaisons of language or attempts at amplification. Such things destroy the clean, stark presentation of the logic.

It destroys the ease with which the logic can be comprehended if the reader must wade through 30 words before he grasps the point. If you find yourself with more than a dozen words, or more than one subject and predicate, think again. 3 You must be totally ruthless in limiting your points to the outline of your deductive or inductive argument. Most people ignore this requirement and end up simply listing points, without regard to the niceties of either induction or deduction. You know that there are 79 === Page 92 === 80 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE never more than four points in a chained deductive argument, and never more than five in an inductive one.

While this is lovely for the reader, it can be a bit difficult for the writer, because it imposes some strict rules on him. === Page 93 === HOW TO HIGHLIGHT THE STRUCTURE Decimal numbering . Many companies, and most government institutions, like to use numbers rather than headings to emphasize the subdivisions of a document, and some go so far as to number every para­ graph. This approach is claimed to have the advantage that any single topic or recommendation can be easily and precisely referred to. However, frequent index numbers do tend to interrupt the reader's concentration on the content of the document, or on any section of it, as a whole. If you decide that you prefer to have numbering because of its value as a quick guide, you would probably be wise to use it in conjunction with, rather than as a replacement for, headings. The headings have the value of enabling the reader to pick up the gist of the ideas quickly as he reads. And they are quite useful in refreshing his memory if he finds he has to go back to the document several days after his initial reading. In addition, you will usually find that saying 'In Section 4.1 on manu­ facturing profits .. .' is clearer as a reference in jogging someone's comprehension and thinking than is saying only 'In Section 4.1 .. .' In the former case, the person has the general idea in mind as he turns to the specific reference; in the latter, he must get to it before he can begin to think about it. The excerpt shown in Exhibit 26, from the opening of Chapter 5 of Antony Jay's fine book, Effective Presentation (or The New Oratory, as it is known in the United States), illustrates the way you want your document to end up looking if you use the headings/ number form. Wh9t numbering system should you use? This one is very common: I. There is no other animal that will suffer to the death to aid its master as will a dog 1. Other animals will run when danger nears a. The dog will remain i. Even though it might mean death. This one is probably simpler to use: 1 . There is no other animal",

This is a constantly recurring question, and one to which more people come up with the wrong answer than any other. To start with, let us agree that the best talker is the most natural. He is easy, fluent, friendly, amusing and free from the fetters that seem to bind others to small pieces of paper. He is just talking to us in the most natural way in the world: no script for him -how could there be? He is talking only to us and basing what he says on our reactions as he goes along. Such a talk cannot by definition be scripted. 5.1 THE PROBLEMS OF UNSCRIPTED PRESENTATION For most of us, however, that sort of performance is an inspiration rather than a description. Our tongues are not so honeyed, and our words are less winged. And even for those who can on occasions touch those heights, there are three difficulties. 5.1.1. Visuals A brilliant talker does not need visual aids to stop the audience from falling asleep, but the subject of a presentation very often demands them. And if you have them, it can be fatal to depart from the prepared order in which they are to appear. The slides and flip charts are in prearranged sequence, the operator has a fixed point at which to leave the slide machine and go outside to the film projector, and a brilliant extempore performance will mess the whole thing up. 5.1.2. Time A presentation is almost always limited in time, and a certain amount has to be said in that time. Without fairly careful scripting, time is likely to be wildly overrun, or important points omitted. 5.1.3. The best way If you accept that certain points",

There is a best order in which to make the points. There is a best way of putting them to make them clear to the audience. There are best words and phrases to emphasize your arguments. Quite soon you discover that any genuinely spontaneous performance is not practicable, so it might as well all be scripted. Most people get to this stage, and this is where it all goes wrong. They sit down at their desk, write out what they want to say, hand it to their secretary, and tell themselves that they have written their presentation. But they haven't. They have written a paper. 5.2 DON'T READ THEM A PAPER I am not sure why it should be slightly offensive and insulting to have a document read to you, or obviously memorized and recited at you, in this sort of situation. Eminent professors read papers to learned societies, and no one complains: but in that case the audience are usually receiving (or hope they are receiving) a privileged preview of a new contribution to knowledge which will later be published ... .·. i === Page 95 === HOW TO HIGHLIGHT THE STRUCTURE writing. Accordingly, you would not number the paragraphs in initial intro­ ductions, in concluding summaries, in linking comments, or in the introduction to subpoints. Indented display Sometimes your document will be so short that neither headings nor decimal numbering would be appropriate to high­ light the divisions of your thinking. Nevertheless, you will still be dealing with groupings of ideas, and you will want to highlight them in some way. Groups of points supporting or explaining an overall idea are always easier for the reader to absorb if they are set off so as to be easily distin­ guishable as a group. Consider, for example, the two versions of the memorandum shown in Exhibit 27. Exhibit 27-A I have scheduled a Creative Thinking session with Frank Griffith and the industrial engineers for the second week of September, and for Al Beam and his staff for the third week of September.

Admittedly, they save only tiny amounts of the reader's time, but if he is a person who has scores of documents passing over his desk each day, the value of such small savings is considerable. In general, the major rule to remember when you set your ideas off in this way is that you want to be sure to express them in the same gram­ matical form.

You can generally identify your Subject without much effort, determine the reader's Question, think through the Situation and the Complication, and proceed with a listing of your major points. With your title and major side headings decided, you can then settle to the serious business of putting it all into writing. But no matter how carefully you have done your thinking in coming up with this initial structure, you are unlikely to produce a first draft that is perfectly logical and obeys all the rules. Points that seem to group logically in pyramid form often prove to have only a tenuous connection when clothed in prose. And watertight arguments have been known to spring gaping holes when you try to marshal valid support. Unfortunately, you are unlikely to be able to see these flaws without making a special effort to do so. Once you put ideas in writing, they take on an incredible beauty in the author's eyes. They seem to glow with a fine patina that you will be quite reluctant to disturb. The most efficient way to overcome this psychological impediment is to have a checklist of rules you apply to every grouping in the structure, so that you are forced to look at it critically. In this way your parental pride is backed into abeyance, and you can be objective about what you see. (This approach applies equally effectively, of course, to reading some­ one else's draft.) There are essentially four sets of such rules available to help you focus your critical faculties: 1 You can question",

In reading this material, it may strike you that some parts are both more technical and more abstract than you are used to from the earlier chapters. Alas, there seems to be no other way to explain the concepts clearly than to outline the theory behind them first. However, proper application of the concepts is so essential to clear writ­ ing that I'm sure you will find the extra effort required to understand the theory well worthwhile. === Page 103 === Questioning the order of a grouping You know that ideas in any grouping must be placed in logical order. In deductive groupings, of course, that is no problem, since logical order is the order imposed by the structure of the argument. In inductive group­ ings, however, you have a choice of how to order. Thus, you need to know how to make the choice, and how to judge that you have made the right choice. To this end you must understand that ideas grouped together in writing are never brought there by chance. They are always picked out of your mind because it sees them as having a logical relationship. For example: • Three steps to solve a problem. • Three key factors for success in an industry. • Three problems in a company. To see such relationships, the mind must have performed a logical analysis. In that case, the order you choose should reflect the analytical activity that your mind performed to create the grouping. The mind can perform only three analytical activities of this nature (Exhibit 28). 1 It can determine the causes of an effect. Whenever you make statements in writing that tell the reader to do something -fire the sales manager, say, or delegate profit responsibility to the regions - you do so because you believe the action will have a particular effect. You have determined in advance the effect you want to achieve, and then identified the action necessary to achieve it. When several actions are together required to achieve the effect",

The steps required to complete the process or implement the system can only be carried out one at a time, over time. Thus, a grouping of steps that represents a process or system always goes in time order. 91 === Page 104 === 92 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Exhibit 28 The source of the grouping ... dictates its order J.

You are familiar with this technique in creating organization charts or picturing the structure of an industry. If you are going to determine the 'key factors for success in an industry,' for example, you must first visualize the structure of that industry. Having done so, you determine what must be done well to succeed in each part of it. The resulting grouping of three or four key factors would then logically be ordered to match the order of the parts shown in the structure you visualized. This is structural order. 3 it can classify like things together. Whenever you say that a company 'has three problems,' you are not speaking literal truth.

You are saying that each possesses a characteristic by which you are able to identify it as a particular kind of problem -say because each one is the result of a refusal to delegate authority. All three problems are the same in that each possesses this characteris­ tic, but they are all different in that each possesses it to a different degree. (If they possessed it to the same degree, you could not distinguish between them on this basis.) Because they are different, therefore, you rank them in the order in which they possess to the greatest degree what­ ever characteristic made you identify them as problems in the first place. This is called ranking order. These orders can be applied singly or in combination, but one of them must always",

What you are doing in a time­ ordered grouping is spelling out the steps a person must take to achieve a particular effect, in the order in which he must take them. Although it seems a simple discipline to impose, it is extraordinary how frequently people fail to impose it. Consequently, the most common logical flaw you are likely to find in a first draft is improper time groupings. The trick in sorting them out is to visualize yourself taking the actions in each case. Ask yourself, 'What would I do first if I were doing this? What second? etc.' Answering the question can help you to uncover instances where your thinking has been incomplete, your logic confused, or your grouping false.

Now can you see an order? === Page 107 === QUESTIONING THE ORDER OF A GROUPING Business definition requires careful analysis: In defining marketsegments. In assessing your competitive position in each segment. In tracking changes in position over time. False grouping You can see the power of the technique in identifying improper order because of confused logic. It also lets you identify when you have brought ideas together that don't belong in the grouping, as here: The traditional focus of investment evaluation isto compare future returns ahd probable costs. It is often technically unsound. It rests on simplistic concepts. It results in misleading prescriptions. Are these ideas in order of importance? In time order? In structural order? Or in none of the above? If you look critically you can see that the third idea is the effect of the other two. Thus, he seems to be saying: Evaluating investments by comparing future returns to probable costs .results in misleading prescriptions. The concept itself is simplistic. Its application is often technically unsound. The order is time order, in the sense that you have to have the concept before you can apply it badly. But do you need more than a bad concept and bad application of it for misleading prescriptions to result? Is the first one alone enough? I don't know the answer. What I am trying to demon­ strate here is that once you impose a logical order on the ideas, you are then in a position to check that the thinking is complete. You cannot do so while the concept itself is unclear. Sometimes you will find that time order is imposed on an existing struc­ ture, so that",

To that end let's look at structural order. 95 === Page 108 === 96 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Structural order First, what exactly is structural order? It is the order that reflects what you see once you have visualized something - either by diagram or map, by drawing or photograph. The 'something' you visualize can be real or conceptual, an object or a process. It must, however, have been properly divided to show its parts. Creating a structure When you divide a whole into its parts -whether it be a physical whole or a conceptual one -you must make sure that the pieces you produce are: ® Mutually exclusive of each other. • Collectively exhaustive in terms of the whole. I abbreviate this mouthful to MECE, but it is a concept you no doubt apply automatically every time you create an organization chart (Exhibit 29). Mutually exclusive means that what goes on in the Tire Division is not duplicated in Housewares, and what goes on in Sports Equipment is dis­ tinct from both. In other words, no overlaps. Collectively exhaustive means that what goes on in all three divisions is everything that goes on in the Akron Tire and Rubber Company. In other words, nothing left out. If you apply these rules when you divide, you can be sure that the struc­ ture you create shows all the pieces that must be described if you are to explain it to someone else. Structural order at its simplest, then, means that you will describe the pieces of the structure as they appear on the diagram. But how do you know what order to put them in on the diagram? This question most frequently arises when people draw organization charts. The order you put the boxes in on an organization chart will reflect the principle of division you employed to create them.

Thus, suppose you had created this set of departments in reorganizing a city government: 1 Housing 2 Transportation 3 Education 4 Recreation 5 Personal health 6 Environmental health These are the activities for which you think the city is responsible, and the order in which you put them reflects the order in which the city govern­ ment would have to be concerned about its populace if it were starting the city from scratch. Forcing yourself to see an order, particularly if you are creating something new like an organization, permits you to check that you have been collectively exhaustive for your purposes. In dividing things other than organizations, however, your purpose is generally to analyze how those things function. You are therefore divid­ ing by functioning part, and you show the parts in the order in which they would be expected to perform that function. Thus, if you were dis­ cussing a radar set, you would order its parts to reflect the order of their functioning: 97 === Page 110 === 98 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE 1 Modulator 2 Radio-frequency oscillator 3 Antenna with suitable scanning mechanism 4 Receiver 5 Indicator The modulator takes in power that the oscillator then gives out. The antenna concentrates that power into a beam, the receiver takes in signals passed back from the beam's scanner, and the indicator in turn presents the data. Describing a structure Once the structure is set up, one way to describe it is to follow it from the top down and from left to right, describing each part in the order in which it appears. This is the form you would follow if you were giving a techni­ cal description of the radar set described above, or any other technical description of a piece of machinery. However, you can also impose a process order on your description. To",

Suppose, for example, you had the structure of a city government shown at the top of Exhibit 31, and you were recommending replacing it with that shown at the bottom. You would be recommending four changes to get from the first struc­ ture to the second. In what order should you state them? They are all equally important, so you cannot put them in order of importance. They must, in theory, all be done at the same time, so that kind of time order is not appropriate. === Page 111 === QUESTIONING THE ORDER OF A GROUPING Exhibit 30 Map of the Sinai Desert (From The New Yorker, June 4, 1979, 'Sinai: The Great and Terrible Wilderness' by Burton Bernstein.) Jordan Egypt Saudi Arabia On any map of the Middle East, the Sinai Peninsula sits dead center, an almost perfect inverted isosce­ les triangle, a sharp wedge that seems to cleave Africa from Arab Asia. Depending on one's political persuasion, it can be seen in several other contexts: as an eastern arm of Egypt, holy Egyptian soil, sev­ ered from its motherland only a little more than a century ago by the Suez Canal; as a natural and logical southern extension of Israel, a massive broadening of the Negev Desert; as a northern adjunct of Saudi Arabia, separated from that immensity by the narrow Gulf of Akaba; or, simply, as an ancient land bridge connecting East and West, a handy route for caravans and invading armies.

Thus, my first step would be to group the many departments into the six shown. The second step would be to put the Policy and Finance Committee in charge of the whole. The third step would be to create the two groups to support the Committee, and the final one would be to create the administrative team needed to manage the paperwork. Imposing a structure You can also use the concept of structural order to help you sort out faulty logic in a grouping.

This is the order you impose on a grouping when it brings together a set of things you have classified as being alike because they possess a characteristic in common -e.g., three problems, four reasons, five variables. Creating proper class groupings In classifying, when you say, 'The company has three problems,' your mind automatically separates these three problems from all other possible prob­ lems the company has or could have, creating a bifurcate structure like that shown in Exhibit 32. The two classes formed are by definition collec­ tively exhaustive, and are of course meant to be mutually exclusive. You prove they are mutually exclusive by defining quite specifically what characteristic they have in common, and then searching your knowledge to make sure you have included in your grouping all known items with this same characteristic. Then you place them in the order of the degree to which each possesses the characteristic by which you classified it -pre­ senting the strongest one first. (Many people ask me whether, having determined the relative weight of the points, you always have to put the strongest one first. They point out that it would be more dramatic to put the weakest one first and work up to the strongest one. It would indeed be more dramatic, but would it be clearer? I think not, and so I prefer strongest-to-weakest. However, this is a question of style, predicated on appeal to emotions, and in some cases you may quite legitimately decide to reverse the order for greater emo­ tional impact.) Exhibit 32 Classification limits your thinking to a narrow universe* organization problems that. .. 3,000 organization problems 2,997 other organization problems * ... have a set of things in common you can rank === Page 115 === QUESTIONING THE ORDER OF A GROUPING Were the process described above all there is to classifying ideas, there would be very little to say about problems in ordering them. However, clas­ sifying is a ubiquitous human habit. People classify everything they see as soon as they see it, simply by naming what it is. Unfortunately, when they come to ideas they do not limit themselves only to creating classes of points that are alike by virtue of their possessing a characteristic in common. They",

This is a perfectly legitimate thing to do in writing, provided that you are clear about the source of your grouping and reflect accordingly the order it imposes. But more often than not, the great pleasure authors feel in having thought up three or four points to include in a grouping prevents them from questioning the logic of its origin. Let me give you an example of perfectly acceptable, but indiscriminate classifying, and then show you how to use this knowledge to discover flaws in what seem like proper class groupings. Several years ago Bankers Trust Company reprinted a 1921 piece by James Harvey Robinson called The Mind in the Making. In it Robinson said: 'We do not think enough about thinking, and much of our confusion is the result of current illusions in regard to it. Let us forget for the moment any impressions we may have derived from the philosophers, and see what seems to happen in ourselves.' He then proceeded to classify the various kinds of thinking as shown in Exhibit 33. You see there four class groupings. Only the first and third of these appear to reflect the act of grouping by common characteristic. The second and fourth present a process, answering the question 'How?' Looking at the first grouping for a moment, the technique I use to deter­ mine its validity is to question its origin: 1 What does he label the points as? Things that determine the course of the reverie. 2 Can I find anything more specifically the same about them? They are all emotional reactions wehave to the world. 3 Can I justify their order on that basis? Most commonly felt reaction first. 4 Arethere any missing? Probably not. 103 === Page 116 === 104 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Exhibit 33 The Classes of Thinking Our hopes, 1 ~ fears, and desires Indulging .k in reverie Our Ii es and about dislikes ourselves Our loves, hates, and 2 resentments Considering the reasons for Making Considering practical the reasons against decisions Weighing the difference Religion 1 d b th Family relations mpose y . e Property 3 group in which Business our The state Rationalizi(g we happen to /iv our country beliefs Finding fault and Resulting ~with circumstances opinions from our",

If you can, then you have enlarged on his thinking; if you can't, then you must concede that his reasoning makes sense.

It appears to apply equally to all three points and we cannot think of others to add to the grouping. To repeat, my purpose here is to show you that groupings are not just drawn out of the air, but reflect an analytical assessment that implies a strict order. You want deliberately to look for this order in every class grouping so that you can be certain you are saying what you mean. 105 === Page 118 === 106 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Identifying improper class groupings To show you the difference it can make to your thinking, let's look at some examples. Suppose you came across this: The traditional financial focus of investment evaluation results in misleading prescriptions for corporate behavior. , . Corporations should invest in all opportunities where probable returns exceed the cost of capital. Better quantification of future uncertainty and risk is the key to more effective resource allocation. Planning and capital budgeting are two separate processes; capital budgeting is a financial activity. Top management's role is to challenge the numbers rather than the underlying thinking. Now apparently these are the four misleading prescriptions that result from the traditional financial focus. More specifically, they are commonly believed 'rules of thumb' in corporations. But are they? If you reword them as results, they say, to abbreviate them: Encourages corporations to invest. Emphasizes quantification of uncertainty. Separates plahning ahd capital budgeting. Leads top management to focus on the numbers, All but the third can now be seen as part of a process of decision making, which would dictate a different order, which in turn would lead to a clearer point at the top: The traditional financial focus of investment evaluation can result in poorresource allocation decisions: Emphasizes quantification of future uncertainty and risk as .the key to choosing among projects. Leads top management to focus on the numbers rather than the underlying thinking. Encourages investment in all opportunities where probable returns exceed the cost of capital, ignoring other considerations. === Page 119 === QUESTIONING THE ORDER OF A GROUPING That one was easy to sort out because the kind of idea you were dealing with was easy to identify simply by reading",

Very often, however, you will find yourself with several kinds of ideas whose class membership is not that easy to see at first reading. Problems with sales and inventory systems reports: 1 Report frequency is inappropriate. 2 Inventory data is unreliable. 3 Inventory data is too late. 4 Inventory data cannot be matched to sales data. 5 People want reports with better formats. 6 People want elimination of meaningless data. 7 People want exception highlighting. 8 People want to do fewer calculations manually. The trick is to go through and sort them into rough categories, as a prel­ ude to looking more critically later. You get the categories by defining the kind of problem they are discussing: Timing 1 Report frequency is inappropriate 3 Inventory data are too late Data 2 Inventory data is unreliable 4 Inventory data cannot be matched to sales data 6 People want elimination of meaningless data Format 5 People want better report formats 7 People want exception highlighting 8 People want to do fewer calculations manually. You have a double ordering task here. First, in what order do you put timing, data, and format? That depends on the process you think they reflect. Here we have two possibilities: we could be talking about the process of preparing the reports, or we could be talking about the process of reading the reports. If you are talking about preparing the reports, you would complain first about the data, then about the format, then about the timing, because that is the order in which the preparer would deal with them. On the other 107 === Page 120 === 108 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE hand, if you are talking about reading the reports, you would complain first about the timing, then about the format, then about the data, for the same reason. How about ordering the ideas in each grouping? Under Timing, points 1 and 3 should probably be reversed, as you worry about lateness before you worry about frequency. Under Data, I should think you would com­ plain first that a good deal of the data are meaningless, what is not meaningless is unreliable, and what is reliable can't be matched. Process order again. Under Format, points 7 and 8 would be subsets of point 5, with the 'fewer calculations' probably coming before the 'highlighting.' A great value of the exercise has been to show that in some",

Here's another example: The causes of New York's decline are many and complex. Among them are: 1 Wage rates higher than those that prevail elsewhere in the country. 2 High energy, rent and land costs. 3 Traffic congestion that forces up transportation costs. 4 A lack of modern factory space. 5 High taxes. 6 Technological. change. 7 The competition of new centers of economic concentration in the Southwest and the West. 8 The refocusing of American. economic and social life in the suburbs.

It could buy the plastic bottles on the outside, or it could create its own plas­ tic bottle manufacturing capability. 109 === Page 122 === 110 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE There are a number of internal/external risks and constraints that preclude an investment in any plastic bottle venture: 1 Technical risk -undeveloped design problems. 2 Environmental risk -legislated nonreturnable ban. 3 Premium risk -consumer rejection of a premium package during an inflationary period. 4 Nonexclusivity: (a) outside sales diminish marketing impact, (b) sales to others may be difficult with our ownership. 5 Capital intensiveness -the project has an extremely long payback period. 6 Negative EPS impact (accentuated by leveraging). 7 Near-term R&D expense. 8 Corporate cash flow problems -funds needed for expansion of existing business. 9 Price slashing by glass manufacturers and/or lower than projected glass inflation rate vis-a-vis plastic. 10 Other plastic manufacturers may effect dramatic price cuts upon entry due to lower return on investment goals (many are in 7-10% range). 11 Entry in the container industry which is typified by lower margins and in which the key is to be the lowest cost producer.

It is the imposition of the structure that permits you to see flaws and omissions. To summarize, I have tried to demonstrate with all these examples that checking order is a key means of checking the validity of a grouping. With any grouping of inductive ideas that you are reviewing for sense, always begin by running your eye quickly down the list. Are they indeed all from the same source: a process, a structure, a class? Are they all in logical order: time order if the source is a process, structural order if the source is a structure, ranking order if the source is a class. Once you know the grouping is valid, you are in a position to draw a logical inference from it, as explained in Chapter 9. p~ ·",

By forcing themselves actually to visualize the structure, they can match their points to it. Thus, they can check not only that the points are in the right order, but also that all those that should be included are included. In the particular example I gave, the structure was that of a Department responsible for building and maintaining a state highway system. Once you saw the match between its activities and the ideas in the grouping, the proper order became obvious. The document from which the grouping was taken came from a con­ sulting firm, and is known as a Letter of Proposal. Such letters spell out for a prospective client what his problem is and how the consulting firm pro­ poses to go about solving it. If the proposal is accepted, the consulting firm will then carry out the analyses required to solve the problem and write a report embodying its findings, conclusions, and recommendations. Coming up with those findings, conclusions, and recommendations requires the creation and use of a number of analytical structures. These structures, in turn, must be referred to in checking the order and com­ pleteness of the ideas generated by them. Those of you who write documents that detail the results of problem solving, whether in consulting or in business, may find it useful to review the general problem-solving process and some of the analytical structures associated with it, as a basis for looking critically at what is said. The problem-solving process Ideally, problem solving begins with problem setting -i.e., identifying precisely what you mean by 'the problem' and how you will know when you have achieved a solution. When you identify a problem, essentially what you do is recognize that a particular situation yields a specific result. I I. 113 === Page 126 === 114 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE The problem is either that you do not like the result (e.g., Sales are down 1 O percent), or that you cannot explain the result (e.g., What determines what we think? Is it the structure of the brain? Is it our genetic makeup?) Changing the result in",

Finding the explanation in the second demands the somewhat more creative hypothesizing of scientists and inventors. I am talking here about routine problem solving. (See the Appendix for a discussion of creative problem solving.) This process has been described in a number of different, sometimes conflicting, ways. The simplest, most practical description I have seen was set out by my friend B. Robert Holland in his manual, Sequential Analysis, published by McKinsey & Company in 1972. According to Holland, the process consists of answer­ ing a series of questions in logical sequence: 1 What is the problem? 2 Where does it lie? 3 Why does it exist? 4 What could we do about it? 5 Whatshould we do aboutit? The answer to each question must be structured visually before you can be said fully to understand what you have found. Let me take you through the sequence using a simple example, and then show you how creating the structures required at each stage can aid you in writing clearly about your results. In doing so, let me point out that I recognize that you may in fact not go about problem solving in this clean, compelling manner. The problem situation you face can be very murky, and information can come at you in a random way, in a variety of misleading or overwhelming forms. And you always have the personalities of the people with whom you are working to consider. What I am advocating, however, is that when you sit down to put your thoughts in order prior to writing, you try to force an analytical structure on your findings and conclusions. The example I will use is this: Suppose that you are a cigarette manu­ facturer and you discover that the productivity of the machines in Department A is lower than the productivity of the machines in all your other departments -i.e., Department A turns out fewer cigarettes per machine than the others. === Page 127 === QUESTIONING THE PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCESS What is the problem? The problem is that you do not like the result. But that is not a complete definition of the problem. To what precisely do you object? How will you know when the problem is solved? In effect, what question do you want your analysis to answer? What you want to do here is",

You may have to gather some data in order to answer the question, but it should be easily available. For example, this particular company measured its machines in terms of productive hours per day, and the figures were available for each machine. The useful image, then, would probably be some visualization between the good performers and the poor ones. Now you can say to yourself, 'We're losing 2 hours of productivity a day. What I want to know is what is causing those lost hours? Or more specif­ ically, how do I eliminate the causes of lost hours?' 6-hour day Machine A Where does the problem lie? 8-hour day Others Next you gather the data that will allow you to picture the situation within which the problem occurs -i.e., the set of activities that produce lost hours.

These are the possibilities that you must investigate. In creating a useful structure of the situation, you are trying to show how the elements in the situation relate functionally and interact as a system to accomplish a specific purpose. Sometimes these relationships are not at all obvious, so that to diagram them you must first do a good deal of digging. Keep digging until (1) you are sure you have identified all the parts in the system, (2) you can arrange them in sequential order, and (3) you can clearly show inputs and outputs. Why does the problem exist? The overall structure of the situation will indicate a number of directions in which your analysis can proceed. In our cigarette example we know we can gather facts that let us judge whether the machines were without raw material, or without maintenance, etc. -a relatively simple exercise. In more complex situations, however, you will have to probe more deeply into both the things and the processes that make up the structure. You will be trying to make clear the components of each, their importance to each",

(A number of analytical structures have been developed that permit you to initiate this probing and display its results so that they can be thought about productively. I will talk about several of the most useful of these in the next section.) Clearly, in these more complex situations you will also have to be selec­ tive. Not all possibilities are likely to prove equally important in solving the problem. Consequently, you will have to make a judgment early on about which areas deserve the greatest concentration of effort. Such judgments can only be based on experience in the industry or in solving similar prob­ lems, and are thus generally made by senior members of the consulting staff. What could we do about it? Once the situation has been visualized and analyzed, so that you know why the problem exists, you have a good idea of what needs to be changed. However, there may appear to be alternative ways to change, each of which derives logically from the structure of the activity under study. They must now be tested to determine which way most effectively creates the desired result. In our cigarette company example, the problem turned out to be that the operators were not 'tuning up' their machines properly, which in turn was the result of inadequate training by their superiors. How could one go about improving the supervision, then? === Page 129 === }_ .. ,, . . ;-, QUESTIONING THE PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCESS You could make the job of training new operators a specific objective in judging the supervisor's performance, you could transfer a supervisor from a more productive department to this one, or you could increase the number of supervisors. Which course of action makes most sense depends on its feasibility and on its likelihood of success (on its benefits and risks, if you like), which must be thoroughly assessed before you choose. What should we do about it? In making the decision to choose one alternative over the next, you must be able to visualize the new situation with the change implemented. Creating this picture should suggest to you the additional changes that must be made to accommodate it, and once again highlight the points that need analysis and verification before you make a final recommendation.

Risks in this context would generally be of three kinds: you will have made a mistake in your assumptions, you might not achieve your objective, or you may inspire retaliation of some kind. Should it look as though the choice is very risky for any one of these rea­ sons, you would want to stop considering it as an alternative. What this section has been saying is that before you can legitimately advise someone on how to change an undesirable result, you must have defined clearly five things: (1) the gap between where he is and where he wants to be, (2) the structure of the situation that gave rise to the gap, (3) the structure of its underlying processes, (4) the alternative ways the struc­ ture could be changed, and (5) the changes required to accommodate the alternative you choose. You can see that completion of Step 1 tells you not only how to direct your analysis of the problem, but also how to write your introduction. It identifies the question your report must be structured to answer. Steps 2 and 3 identify the major analyses that must be completed before you can formulate recommendations to answer the question. Thus, in looking critically at the draft of a report, you will want to make sure first that the introduction reflects a clear definition of the problem, and then that the findings and conclusions derive from appropriate analytical structures. Chances are that you will find glaring omissions in both cases. Defining the problem As I noted earlier, the likelihood is that you will not have done your problem solving in quite the neat and tidy way described, particularly where you face very complex problem situa­ tions. If you feel you have solved the problem, however, you will no doubt 117 === Page 130 === 118 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE have generated sufficient data to be able to re-create the structures used to define the problem, showing: • Where you are now. • Where you want to be. .. The difference between the two. The ease with which re-creating these structures can help you decide what to say in your introduction and how to set up your pyramid may amaze you.

We were to identify and analyze mechanisms: Enabling a transition to digital storage and transmission techniques Required for the cost-effective transmission of documents. The 'Problems of Document Delivery for the Euronet User' were discussed in a technical report pre- pared by the Research Institute last year. On-line search services for scientific and technical • information (STI) enable the user to identify promising references in the literature quickly and easily. But the user's needs are not met until he has a full text copy of the relevant articles, so a speedy, comprehensive and economic document delivery service is needed. The planning study prepared by the Research consultants sheds light on the requirements, problems and possible solutions for doc­ ument ordering and delivery on Euronet/DIANE. DIANE is operational today. The acronym stands for Direct Information Access Network for Europe. It represents the ensemble of information services available through the Euronet telecommunica­ tions network. Euronet itself is a data transmission facility, not an information service. DIANE provides a framework for the services that major European hosts offer via Euronet. The hosts are typically computer service bureaus which store bibliographic data bases. By providing a medium for the introduction of common features, such as standard command language, referral service and user guidance, DIANE presents a clearer image to the user of the wide range of information serv­ ices available through the network. The EEC Committee for Information and Documentation in Science and Technology (CIDSD consid­ ered the Research Institute report, and the comments and recommendations of others who studied it, and recommended additional technical studies. We have undertaken two of these, looking at the closely related technological, economic and man­ agerial issues of converting documents to digital form and delivering them by teletransmission. The background to the study is the rapid development of computing and telecommunications technol­ ogy that might already, or could be expected in the near future, to provide the means of electronic document delivery. This could eliminate, or cut down significantly, the movement of",

Conclusions Our study confirmed that it is technically possible to convert a document into a digital form that can be stored in a computer data base and transmitted by digital telecommu.nications to printers located near to those who wish to read the documents. The cost of digitalization and teletransmission continues to fall. However, expensive equipment is required, and large volumes of documents must be handled to achieve low unit costs. An operation planned on a European scale could deliver documents overnight at a marginal cost per page that is comparable with the charges made by fulfillment centers now meeting requests by copying and mailing documents. We conceived a system, called DDT, which would use existing technology in a new way and looked at the organizational, managerial, legal and regulatory issues involved in establishing it as a Europe­ wide operation. DDT would build on the experience gained with DIANE, and supplement it. It would be a speedy, comprehensive and economic document delivery service, accepting requests in the form of bibliographic references and fulfilling them by teletransmission from data bases of dig­ italized documents. However, we believe that market forces will not bring such a system about. If the demand for quick access to full texts is to be satisfied, then a demonstration project is required. DDT must develop as an open system, through which any information provider can deliver docu­ ments to any user. It must therefore be based on international standards. Further technical studies are needed to determine how to apply existing technology to DDT. === Page 133 === QUESTIONING THE PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCESS 1 Can we convert the printed documents to digital form? 2 Can we store them centrally? 3 Can we transmit them direct at low cost? It would seem, then, that the analysis should have been directed at answering those three questions directly.

The period data in one form or another is input into a computer system no less than three times. Thus, we have created a very inefficient system and have increased the potential for error due to the number of people involved and the related fragmentation. Some of the problems that we've encountered during the 7 periods that we've been involved are: -Inconsistency of data input between periods and between regions. -Incorrect calculation of Variable Costs due to the original computer program design. -Unexplained changes in data points that were previously correct. -Data base was not updated for prior period's information so that this Information had to be posted again on the computer input sheets. Overall Assessment The majority of these problems have arisen due to the cumbersome inefficient nature of the process itself. The fragmentation of the production process has resulted in no one person having control of the data and has created 'gray areas' for which responsibility is unclear. The risk of potential errors has increased, as there is the chance that things will fall between the cracks. The production process sorely needs streamlining, both in terms of the Individual books, as well as in terms of a base computer system that would efficiently execute all of the divisions' common calculations, e.g., rolling data points. Given our current staffing, we cannot handle the production streamlining and control of the graph books. At your convenience, can we discuss how to best proceed? You can see that there are a number of things wrong with the document besides its",

Nevertheless, whenever you outline the problems in a system, you are by implication stating the actions that must be taken to correct the prob­ lems. Thus, as a rule of thumb you should always organize this kind of paper around the changes needed, supporting each suggested change with a discussion of the system and its weaknesses. Visualizing the before, the after, and the differences between the two makes it easy to be specific about what the changes should be: === Page 137 === ~'Y•<{'­ ~fZ., QUESTIONING THE PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCESS \"' Create a data link to permit transmission of data direct to the corporate computer. • Create a reliable routine to computerize graph point generation. • Demand that changes made by presenters be revalidated before use. If these are the major points to be communicated, then they can form the key line of the pyramid (Exhibit 36). They serve to answer the question, 'What changes need to be made to eliminate errors?' It is now a simple matter to work backward to determine what infor­ mation has to be communicated in the introduction to induce the reader to ask that question. In this case, he need only be reminded that he knows about the problem, that he asked to have a suggested solution put in writ­ ing, and that now the document will tell him the solution.

You need these to guide the writing of your introduction and to give direction to your analysis. In doing the analysis, however, you will be creating additional struc­ tures. I'd like to look at a few of the most common of these now, to show how you can use your awareness of them to find flaws in your groupings. Structuring the analysis of the problem When you reach the stage of determining specifically why the problem exists, you will frequently find that the relationships you need to analyze are not directly evident. In that case your strategy should be to visualize the logical structure that must have existed to produce the results that you observe. An excellent method for doing so is to create what are known as logic trees, of which there are several varieties. I know of five, but there are no doubt more. Let me describe these, and then go on to show how you can use the logic-tree concept to find gaps and illogicalities in what you have written. Five typical logic trees The great value of logic trees lies in the fact that they can often reveal where the problem is, why it exists, and what to do about it all in one pic­ ture. The trees differ slightly depending on the kind of structure being shown, but all begin at an end result and branch into causes. 1 Financial structure. Exhibit 37 shows an ROI tree that lays out part of the financial structure of a company, and then permits you to ask questions like 'What might cause sales to be off?' and 'What might cause that cause?' The trick is to create a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive group of causes at each branch. 2 Task structure. A deeper, more explicit approach is to make the tree show the important tasks of the business that it must organize itself to perform (Exhibit 38). To do so you begin with EPS and divide the tree in terms of the company's financial structure, stating each element as a discrete managerial task. Then you impose the Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet on this structure, again stating each item as a task. Contribution in a cigarette company, for example, is composed of Net Sales minus Specification Costs (leaf, packing materials, duty, direct labour), minus Advertising and Promotion.",

You now know the key tasks of the business, and can analyze the numbers in the tree (trends, sensitivities, comparisons to industry and competition) to determine the priorities for performing them to increase EPS. 3 Activity structure. Yet a third approach is to use a tree to trace the activities that have to be performed to produce an undesirable end objective -high costs, for example, or overlong installation times. The trick here is to visualize all the causes that could possibly bring about the effect, and relate them at their proper levels. For example, installation of telephone switching equipment involves work partly done in the contractor's factory and partly done by his men on the site. Elements at the site are the men doing the building, the facilities avail­ able to them, the equipment being installed, the testers testing the equipment, and the customer approving the procedure at various inter­ vals. How do these all relate? As you can see from Exhibit 39, you begin your tree with the effect you are trying to understand, that installations take longer than expected. At the next level you hypothesize the mutually exclusive and collective exhaustive reasons that this could occur: fewer men on each rack, more hours per man on each rack, fewer hours on duty per week. You then take each possible reason and break it down further. What could cause more 127 === Page 140 === 128 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Exhibit 38 Task structure (From Task Analysis, McKinsey & Company, 1972) Increase trading and Increase financial gearing Increase tobacco assets Increase interest received Reduce Increase contribution Reduce oncost and overheads Reduce trading assets Revenue Less specification cost For individual brands Less advertising and promotion For company as a whole reduce in total For company as a whole minimize Elements of volume Revenue, Expense, Investment Increase net sales Reduce leaf Reduce packing materials Reduce duty Reduce direct labour Reduce gift scheme Increase gross margin Reduce advertising and promotion Increase contribution Reduce indirect labour Reduce materials Reduce bought out Reduce salaries Reduce rent",

Either the men are working more slowly, or the job demands more time, or there are unexpected delays. Again, you take each possibility and ask, why would this happen? The result is a list of the areas where facts must be gathered and analyzed. 4 Choice structure. This kind of tree is related to the activity structure, Exhibit 39 Activity Structure in that it attempts to find the causes of an undesirable effect. This time, however, you simply display bifurcate choices until you reach a level where you have more precise knowledge of the likely causes. In Exhibit 40, for example, if your sales support is ineffective, it can be ineffective at retail or at === Page 141 === QUESTIONING THE PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCESS Exhibit 39 Activity Structure Fewer hours on X ~doty/week !nstal- Fewer men/ lations rack on site take ~~:~er More ma~ hours/ y rack on site --ECo>h Fewer incentives Tenure Promotion ~~;e~e~~~u~ ~:t~:t ~:~~:i:~ad:;~;i~n~:ns -f Lower supervision hours/supervisor Slower work pace Poorer supervision Fewer supervision/man Less skill/supervisor Less skilled ------+=Lower te.nure work force . _ t [:~;~;~;:;1~~~/year Poorer working less specialization instructions Poorer tools i ~·;:,;:~'done ~ ;,:,';.~: ;;i:;r,':',\" \"\"\";\" More diffi.cult ~~~1:~n:r;~1;::estrktions More time work environment Environmental problems, e.g. dust required on site More tasks r~quire1______C ~0°;;e~e;~~~i~;e to complete JOb L Duplicated work because of errors More stringent installation specs Late changes in plans ~xne:~=~~=~ delays ~o~r sequencing/ P t1m1ng of tasks t Prncedurnl del'Y' Use of manpower elsewhere at short notice Meribuildirig Waiting for correct--f lricorrect iaci!ities external inputs Inadequate Equipment late Testers Inputs headquarters.

First you pick the store, then you call on it, then you do the right things in it, either well or poorly. The result again is a list of the analyses that must be performed, and that will tell you how to solve the problem. 5 Sequential structure. A more sophisticated version of the choice structure is what I call a sequential structure (Exhibit 41 ), and again I am indebted to B. Robert Holland for the example. The value of this structure lies both in its completeness and in the order in which analyses of each element are meant to be performed. For example, your analysis might identify several indicators that your mar­ keting programme is less than adequate. Let's say the packaging is wrong, the advertising is wrongly directed, the promotion is sloppy, and those people who do buy the product don't use it frequently enough. Weaknesses identified at the top must be corrected before those at the bottom. Thus, there is no point in trying to coax people to use the 129 === Page 142 === 130 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Exhibit 40 Choice Structures How product more frequently before you get your promotional house in order, and no point in spending money on promotion if you will continue to advertise to the wrong people. Use of the logic-tree concept Once you understand the technique for displaying the logical relationships between groups of activities, to show their cause-effect nature, you can use the concept to question the logic of what you've written. A good example of how to do so can be seen in analyzing the Key Issues shown in Exhibit 42. Here again we have a very wordy, ugly, mediocre expression of a busi­ ness message. And again its impenetrability results from the lack of a clear image in the writer's mind that he wanted to communicate, itself the result of a confused approach to the problem solving. The text was written to a company that supplies various kinds of pipes and fittings to construction sites. It purchases them from suppliers, and stocks them in a central warehouse; this warehouse in turn supplies a dozen or so smaller warehouses in regions throughout the state.

These issues are preliminary only, and we would expect others to emerge. 1. Is the present inventory management system suitable for all elements of the business? We understand that a computerized 'IMPACT' type system is in use. We are familiar with systems of this type, and find them quite useful in non-manufacturing, stocking busi­ nesses in which thousands of relatively stable stock-keeping units are processed. However, it may not be as effective a method as others of determining stock levels and placing orders both centrally and in the regions. 2. With present systems, procedures, and organizational rela­ tionships, what is the level of inventory investment necessary to meet customer service objectives? A determination should be made of the investment required to serve present markets with the current products offered under existing procedures. This will provide the proper base from which to determine opportunities for improvements through change as opposed to those that could be realized through more con­ trol or discipline in the use of present systems and techniques. 3. Are centralized inventories cost effective for you? In the Piping Group, two centralized inventory pools are maintained for tube prod­ ucts, and valves and fittings. These pools were established when the business was small and working capital extremely limited. The central pool was intended to",

What are present levels of obsolete and slow-moving invento­ ries? Excessive inventories are frequently a result of problems in this area. A key part of the analysis should concentrate on determining cur­ rent inventory excesses. More importantly, we will determine the root causes so that recommendations to prevent reoccurrences can be developed. 5. With changes in inventory policies, organization structures, and systems, how much improvement can be made in inventory turn? This is the key issue, and could affect long-term business strategy. Management is willing to consider changes in long-established operat­ ing procedures if such changes can reduce the working capital intensity of the business. === Page 145 === QUESTIONING THE PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCESS company has just been taken over, and the new owners think that an inventory cost of $27 million for the central warehouse is too high. In addi­ tion, because the central warehouse is frequently out of stock of some items, the outlying warehouses also order direct from suppliers, further increasing inventory cost. In this situation, does Exhibit 42 properly list the so-called 'key issues'? An issue, by the way, is a question so phrased as to require a yes-or-no answer. Phrasing it in this form permits you to direct your analysis to a spe­ cific end product needed to prove or disprove your understanding of the cause of a problem. Such questions as number two, 'What level of inventory investment is necessary?' are accordingly not issues. Stated as an issue, the question would be 'Is the present level of inventory too high?' or 'Do we need as much inventory as we now have?' Given your understanding of the problem-solving process from section one, you will be able to recognize the question as originally stated as an attempt to define how we will know when we have solved the problem. The problem now is that the cost of the inventory is $27 million, and it should be instead some other number. The first thing to establish is what that other number should be, which will prove that in fact the present levels are too high. Assuming that the figure is too high, we can use a tree diagram to iden­ tify the possible causes of its being too high. What does one do to create inventory at high levels?",

(See Chapter 9 for a discussion of end products.) 'Issues' is apparently the popular buzzword in business circles these days. Exhibit 43 shows another set of issues, more confused if possible than the previous group. Here they are meant to identify the alternative ways available to reduce the cost of energy consumed in a factory. If you tried to diagram the alternative ways to reduce the cost of energy, you would get a choice diagram like this: 10 Cut energy costs Cut BTUs used Cut cost of each BTU Repair/ Fix existing maintain 1 use less 6 Modify Create new -[ Buy J 3 equipment to 4 use less Design Use lower cost J { fuels 1n ex1st1ng 5 equipment Add new J equipment that uses less 3 costly fuel And once you have the diagram, you can see that Issues 7, 8, and 9 simply don't relate to the subject. Issues 1, 2, and 6 are related to fixing the existing equipment to use less, Issues 3 and 4 are related to creating new equipment to use less, Issue 5 speaks to using lower cost fuels in existing equipment, and adding new equipment that uses less costly fuel is touched on in Issue 3. Issue 10 refers to cutting energy costs altogether. Remember, all groupings of ideas must have had their origin in an ana­ lytical activity of the mind. In situations where you are trying to solve a problem, the likelihood is that your groupings derived from one or another of the structures you created to guide your analysis. Matching your ideas to these structures can help you to verify their logical validity. 135 === Page 148 === 136 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE (The entire process of problem solving, incidentally, is called Abduction, to distinguish it from Induction or Deduction. For a detailed discussion of Abduction, particularly as it applies to scientific problem solving, see the Appendix.) === Page 149 === Questioning the summary statement We come at last to consider the first rule of the pyramid: ideas at any level must be summaries of the ideas grouped below them, because they were in fact derived from them.

But when the grouping is an inductive one, made up of a set of statements that you see as closely related in some way, the idea above must state what the relationship below implies. Most writers don't state the implications of their groupings. As we have seen, their tendency is to tie together ideas that have a general rather than a specific relationship, so that nothing is directly implied. Consequently, they are forced to cap them with what I call intellectually blank assertions: • The company should have three objectives. 11> There are two problems in the organization. • We recommend five changes. I call these statements intellectually blank because they do not in fact summarize the essence of the ideas grouped below them. They simply state the kind of idea that will be discussed. As such they cannot serve as nuggets on which to focus future thinking. This is, of course, the major purpose of summarizing a grouping -to glean an insight about which you can then think further. You will take that summary point and either find others like it (induction) or comment fur­ ther on it (deduction). But you must have a true summary before the process can begin. For example, I once worked with someone who wrote, 'The company has two organization problems' and then listed the two problems. When pressed to state how they were alike so that he could make a proper sum­ mary statement, he discovered that in fact he wasn't talking generally about 'organization problems.' He was talking specifically about 'areas of the organization where greater delegation is needed.' 137 === Page 150 === 138 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Once he saw that, he realized that there were not two of these so­ called problem areas, but four, only one of which he had properly identified. He further realized that his insight was that the major organiza­ tion problem the company faced was its inability to delegate authority. Now having clearly stated the problem he was free to focus his thinking on finding solutions to it. A second reason you want clear summary statements is that it makes life easier for the reader. A document studded with intellectually blank assertions is boring beyond belief to read because it does so little to anchor the reader's perceptions. In addition, there is a real danger that he",

To illustrate, here is an exchange I heard on the radio several years ago: First speaker: John Wain says he believes he is well placed to write this biography of Samuel Johnson for three reasons: The same poor Staffordshire background. The same education at Oxford. The same literary preferences. Second speaker: I don't agree. There are no real truths in Staffordshire. This is a superb example of the second speaker's not grasping what the first meant, because the first speaker did not in fact say what he meant. The second speaker sits poised, with his mind open, waiting for the first speaker to give him his point. But he doesn't state the point, he states 'for three reasons.' Thus, apparently, what the second speaker heard as the major point was, 'The same poor Staffordshire background,' and his mind ignored the other two reasons. So that when he came to reply, he replied to the point he heard. The speakers were speaking directly past each other. Now if instead the first speaker had said, 'John Wain says he is well placed to write this biography of Samuel Johnson because he and Johnson are essentially the same kind of people,' then while the second speaker would have had to listen to the three support points, he would have had to reply to the point that tied them together. What do you have to do to make a proper summary? First, as the pre­ vious two chapters have shown, you have to check the origin of the grouping to make sure it is MECE (i.e., that its order reflects a process, a structure, or a classification). Then you look at the kind of statement you === Page 151 === QUESTIONING THE SUMMARY STATEMENT are making. Regardless of the origin of the idea, its expression will be either as an action statement, telling the reader to do something, or as a situation statement, telling the reader about something. • Summarize the action ideas by stating the effect of carrying out the. actions. • Summarize the situation ideas by stating what is implied by their similarity to each other. Thus, as Exhibit 44 illustrates, summarizing inductive groupings means either determining the effect of actions or drawing an inference from conclusions.

You use them when writing manuals, stating action plans, describing sys­ tems, or spelling out how to go about solving a problem. Since actions are always taken to achieve some purpose, you place these ideas in a causal structure that groups them under the effect they are meant to achieve, approximately as displayed in Exhibit 45. As you can see, if you have a large number of steps to carry out in getting to the end Exhibit 44 The Form of the Argument Dictates the Process of Summarizing DEDUCTIVE INDUCTIVE CAUSES 139 . === Page 152 === 140 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Exhibit 45 Action statements should be grouped in a causal structure result, the hierarchical structure makes it easy for the reader to grasp how they all relate and the order in which they must be carried out. Sorting actions by their effect is an alien kind of activity for most people, while separating various causes from various effects at a number of levels of abstraction leaves them in chaos, logically speaking. There are many reasons for this, chief among them the fact that writers habitually state actions so vaguely that it is difficult for them to determine their pre­ cise effects. In addition, very often a writer doesn't understand the difference between a cause and an effect, and in any case his tendency is to want to group by similarity, since that's his most common thinking activ­ ity. Let me suggest ways to deal with these difficulties. Make the wording specific If you build a causal structure properly, you will be able to say about each grouping of ideas, starting at the bottom, 'I do these three things to achieve the above effect, I do the next higher three things to achieve the next above effect,' etc. Each of the points must be mutually exclusive from the next -i.e., no overlaps -and each grouping of points must be collec­ tively exhaustive in terms of the point at the top. To judge whether the grouping is collectively exhaustive, the effect must be so specifically stated that it implies an end product you can hold in your hand. In other words, you can't say, 'I do these three things so that I can improve profits,' because a 10 percent improvement in profits and a 2",

This kind of state­ ment permits you to judge whether the steps you have grouped together underneath would in fact bring about this end result. You will not always, of course, have a clear numerical goal as your end product. But there will always be some tangible way to judge that the step has been completed. A useful technique is to visualize a real person actu­ ally taking the action, so that you can judge how he will know when he is finished. By that criterion, this sentence is almost pure gibberish: A world consciousness must be developed through which every individual realizes his role as a member of the world community. What does that mean you should do? How will you know when you have done it? Can you visualize someone 'realizing his role'? If you cannot, you do not know what the author actually means. Here is another example where you do not know: Toreduce the chance that conflict will turn to confrontation rather than healthy debate and consideration of issues on their merits, the Task Force must be able to: Handle a variety of personal attitudes. Build favourable rapport with company personnel. Develop good interviewing skills. Plan and conduct interviews effectively, Learnto gain agreement on suggestions while maintaining an .objective posture. What can the writer have had in mind? What is it actually the Task Force must do? And to what end? If they do it, what will they accomplish? As you can see, without knowing what the final objective is meant to be, you cannot judge that the steps below will in fact achieve it. Remember that the technique is to look for an end product or cutoff point that will let you know when the step is completed. To illustrate, opposite are some examples of typically vague statements made in busi­ ness writing, each translated into exactly what was meant. You can see that each translation is easier to comprehend because it brings an image",

More important, perhaps, without this end-product orientation you cannot tell with confidence what the next step should be. 141 === Page 154 === 142 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE What was said What was meant 1 Strengthen regional 1 Assign planning responsibility effectiveness. to the regions. 2 Reduce accounts 2 Establish a system for following receivable up overdue accounts. 3 Review management 3 Determine whether processes. management processes need to be revised. 4 Improve financial 4 Install a system that gives reporting. early notice of change. 5 Tackle strategic 5 Define a clear long-term issues. strategy. 6 Redeploy manpower 6 Place people in positions of resources. comparable responsibility. In number one above, for example, once I visualize the planning responsi­ bility assigned to the regions, I am stimulated to think whether anything else must be done in conjunction with this to accomplish some higher goal, if there is one. Thus, in addition to assigning responsibility, I may need to establish a planning review system to direct their activities. By contrast, if I visualize 'strengthen regional effectiveness', what do I see? Nothing that would identify the obvious need for another step. You will have noted that an idea can serve as both a cause and an effect in a structure. Consequently, all steps should be written so that they imply an end product. When your language does not obey this rule, you confuse your assessment of the proper cause-and-effect relationships. To illustrate an extreme case, take the following set of steps of what a project staff should do: === Page 155 === QUESTIONING THE SUMMARY STATEMENT Identify high-potential profit-improvement projects 1 Review background data. a. Define your key task. b. Collect data for the key task. c. Revrew events and trends affecting the key task. 2 Identify possible projects. a. Measure profit impact of improved performance. b. Assess possible level of improvement and profit impact c. Prepare a draft Profit-Improvement Project Plan. The first step, 'Review background data,' states an essentially meaningless guideline for action. How does one know when he's finished reviewing the data? Is the end product of the review a judgment? A plan of action? Does 'review' mean read? Assess? And if you look at the substeps for guidance on the meaning of 'review,' you find that this cannot in fact be what the person is",

The purpose of the substeps (define the key task, collect the data, etc.) must be to bring about the major step stated above them. Accordingly, you must be able to ask, 'I do these three things so that what will happen?' Here the 'what' cannot logically be 'so that you can review back­ ground data.' A similar complaint can be made about the three substeps under Step 2, 'Identify possible projects.' A good part of the writer's problem here lies in the imprecision of the language he has used to state the steps. Exhibit 46 shows, in the right­ hand column, what in fact the author meant to convey by his choice of words in the left-hand column, and given that intention, what a better list­ ing of the steps might have been. This analysis demonstrates some common errors to look for as you group steps to form a system. Ask yourself the following questions about any grouping: 1 Does the same step appear in more than one place? In the original listing here, for example, the overall step and Step 2 (Identify high­ potential profit improvement projects and Identify possible projects) are essentially the same point. 2 Can I visualize someone taking the action? If you can't, it means you have not stated the end product clearly, which makes it difficult to determine precisely what the reader needs to be told next. Try to think of the end product as being in the reader's hand at the end of the step, and then make your next statement convey an action that builds logically from this situation. 143 === Page 156 === 144 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Exhibit 46 ORIGINAL STATEMENT 1 REVIEW BACKGROUND DATA a.

The 'Review events and trends' step, 1 c on page 143, for example, is a step that disobeys this rule. The disposal to which the information about events and trends is to be put is unclear, since it does not attach logically to that gathered during the previous two steps. Visualizing someone using the end product can help you avoid this kind of vagueness. 3 Will the substeps bring about the step above them? Again referring to 1 c, it is difficult to see how reviewing events and trends contributes directly either to identifying a possible project or to justifying its pursuit, the two major points in the revised listing on Exhibit 46. It probably belongs as a substep under 2a in the new listing, as something to be taken into consideration in assessing the level of profit improvement actually likely to be obtained. === Page 157 === QUESTIONING THE SUMMARY STATEMENT Better statement of steps HOW TO PREPARE A DRAFT PROFIT-IMPROVEMENT PLAN IDENTIFY A POSSIBLE PROJECT a.

As I mentioned earlier, an action statement always implies that someone specific is taking the action. Whoever the specific someone is must stay as the same person throughout the system, or you will find yourself saying something other than what you precisely mean.

Does the author mean 'you should' address the delivery of the speaker and the impact of the speaker, when in fact you are the speaker? Of course not. More likely, he means something like: <> Run through the presentation in the presence of a colleague. • Ask him to assess your delivery and its impact. • Incorporate his suggestions in a second run-through. To summarize, statements about actions are sometimes so numerous that they need to be grouped. To be valid, the groupings must be arranged hierarchically as causes leading to the same effect. The wording of each cause or effect should be such as to imply a clear end product resulting from the accomplishment of the step. When it does not do so, you do not in fact say exactly what you mean. At best, that makes your writing dull; at worst, it makes it useless. Distinguish the levels of action Even if you get the language right, telling cause from effect can be tricky. How do you know which is which? In a causal hierarchy like Exhibit 45, an idea is an effect if you expect the reader to take the action before he takes the next action on the same line. It is a cause if you expect him to take it so that an end product can be created. This sounds more confusing than it is. For example, here is a set of steps an author is recommending that committee chairmen take before they hold committee meetings: 1 Determine the objective of the meeting. 2 Prepare the agenda. 3 Decide the items to be discussed. 4 Decide which people can contribute to the discussion. 5 Specify the end result desired of the discussion. 6 Distribute the information needed to carry out the discussion. 7 Arrange the seating. Are these seven separate steps in a row, each one to be carried out before the next, or does carrying out some of them create others? Take the first one, determining the objective. Do I do that before I prepare the agenda, or do I do it as part of the preparation of the agenda? The only way I know how to answer that question is literally to visualize the way the agenda === Page 159 === QUESTIONING THE SUMMARY STATEMENT would look when finished, and decide what steps someone would have to take, starting",

I would have thought the agenda the author is talking about contains three things: \"' Astatement of the objective. • Alist of the items to be discussed in order to achieve the objective, which would naturally hav~ been drawn from the statement of the objective. • A statement of the end result desired from the discussion of each item. If my visualization is correct, then points 1, 3, and 5 are causes of point 2. Point 2 is on the same line with point 4, however, because it would seem that I must have the agenda in my hand, completed, before I can make a decision on which people to invite. Similarly, I must have the list of people complete before I can decide what information to send them in advance. And I would need to know what each is going to say before I can decide where is the best place for them to sit. So in fact the major points are 2, 4, 6, and 7. That was a relatively simple example, in which it was obvious at once that you were dealing with action ideas. Sometimes, however, you will in fact be dealing with actions that you have worded as if they were conclusions. In most cases a conclusion about the cause of a problem implies the action required to correct it. Since positive recommendations for action are more interesting to read than negative conclusions about problems, it makes sense to turn them into an action structure. For example, suppose you had drawn the following 'major conclusions': 1 Although the company's sales forcehas significant strengths to build upon, substantial efforts will be required near term to ensure future competitive viability. 2 Increases in sales force manpower are requiredtb increase sales call capacityand meet intensified competition. 3 Specialized attention is necessary to improve your competitive position with chain headquarters buying offices. 4 Field representatives may not be allocating their time optimally to achieve maximum salespotential. 147 === Page 160 === 148 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE 5 lnereased .·merchandising requirements and the need for additional selling capadtycHctate the necessity for specialized merchandising resources. 6 Significant mahpovver i ncreaseswill require the formation of additional districts and additional management·•levels. 7 Aformal field 5alesstrategy is needed to provide direction to field.·persohneL 8 Standardized qWantitative measures are needed to guide and evaluatesales.·resourtes.

Clearly these are not quite in end-product terms, but that is not necessary at this stage when you are sorting out your thinking. The technique is to decide roughly what goes with what in terms of cause and effect, and then restate the points to be totally clear. Thus, you would note that 2, 3, and 5 are all adding people, so that their effect would be to increase the size of the sales force. Numbers 4, 6, and 8 have to do with managing the sales force. Number 7 stands alone, so that roughly this is being said: • Create a sales strategy, • Increase the size of the sales force. • Manage the sales force. Why are we doing these things? Apparently to keep our competitive lead. And if we do them all, what in effect will happen? Essentially, it seems we will outcall our competition. So that you might have a structure such as that shown in Exhibit 48. === Page 161 === QUESTIONING THE SUMMARY STATEMENT Exhibit 48 How?

If you try to do so, you will find that you no longer have mutually exclusive groupings, nor will you be able to judge whether you have been collectively exhaustive in listing your actions. For example, in the article on conducting committee meetings already referred to, the author said: • The Chairman.'s job can be divided into two corresponding tasks: Dealing with. the subject. Dealing with the people. What this arrangement of points implies is that during the meeting the Chairman must first deal with the subject, and then when he has finished, deal with the people (whatever 'deal with' means). Obviously, you can't separate his job that way and still reflect",

The points as stated are not the effects of carrying out a coherent set of actions, and thus could not have been arrived at analytically. 149 === Page 162 === 150 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Drawing an inference from conclusions wh t a you can group together by similarity are situation ideas -statements that can be described by such plural nouns as reasons, or problems, or conclusions. You would have classified the ideas in this manner because you believed each of them to possess a characteristic in common. To review what you read in Chapter 7, when you say something like 'The company has three organization problems,' you have in effect taken the entire universe of possible organization problems that the company could have and made a bifurcate division of them: 3 problems that... 3,000 organization problems 2,997 other problems You then ask yourself, 'Why these three and no others? How do I know that the division is mutually exclusive -that nothing in the right-hand oval should be included in the left?' The only way you can know is to define the objects permitted in the left-hand oval so specifically that only the ones you have included will fit the description. In this case, perhaps 'because they are the only organiza­ tion problems that result from not delegating authority properly.' What you are doing is stating precisely how these particular organization prob­ lems differ from all other organization problems in the company. You want to be as specific as possible, since the clearer your definition, the easier it is to make a general statement that applies to them all. It is not always easy to state specifically what a particular set of ideas has in common, since it requires some creative insight. However, there is a technique you can use, which you may already have noted my using in the discussions of earlier examples. That is first to find the structural similarities in the sentences in which the points appear, and then to visualize the rela­ tionships implied between the parts that are similar. === Page 163 === QUESTIONING THE SUMMARY STATEMENT Find the structural similarity Ideas are always written in sentences that have a subjecVpredicate struc­ ture.

If the subjects are all exactly the same, you look for a similarity by which to group among the actions or objects. If the actions or objects are all exactly the same, you look for a similarity by which to group among the subjects. For example, the following statements are all complaints about the figures in an information system. They can thus be related in terms of their verbs. 1 Productivity figures for accounting, estimating, and surveying should be updated. 2 Regular personnel turnover figures are now necessary for all types of employees. 3 Competition information from tenders should be gathered so that the strength of competition in different markets can be monitored. 4 The present information about market rates for salaries is not adequate. 5 Division and project capital lockup figures are needed. I will show you how to visualize these relationships in the next section. For the moment, let's look at the structure of another list. Here are the major points of a presentation given by a consultant to a client who wanted to know whether he should enter the automotive aftermarket -spark plugs, tires, etc. 1 Market is large and growing at an attractive rate. 2 Aftermarket is profitable. 3 Key market characteristics indicate high barriers to entry. 4 Overall trends are favourable, but uncertainties obscure some market segments' outlooks. 5 Overall, the market appears attractive, but is highly fragmented. 151 === Page 164 === 152 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE As you can see, since the subject is the same in each case (aftermarket), the points relate to each other by predicate. But they go together only if the predicates can be found to fall into the same category or categories. You can instantly see that there are both positive and negative points being made, so that there does appear to be some relationship. Again, I will show you how to work it out in the next section. Here I just want to show the process of matching. Sometimes you will go through this matching exercise and not find any relationship at all between the points. That is always an indication that there is something wrong with your grouping and that further thinking is required before you can say precisely what",

Take this listing of the 'Characteristics of the Planning and Control System' being installed in a publishing company: 1 The planning cycle and its attendant control mechanism should be on an annual basis. 2 The plans should be built up via an integrated system. 3 The plans should .be compiled .in the context of a strong directional lead from the top .of the .division. 4 The planning systern will distinguish between the current practice and the planned change. These points say that the things to note about the planning system are that it is annual, integrated, begins at the top, and distinguishes between present and future. So what? That's like your telling me that your wife is five feet eight inches tall, has honey blond hair, likes green dresses, and drives a Buick. I can't put those four points together into an overall state­ ment that will tell me anything interesting about your wife. On the other hand, if you tell me your wife is five feet eight inches tall, has honey blond hair, wizard legs, and her measurements are 36-24-36, then I can say, 'Wow, she must be a knockout lady.' In the first case, you have made four separate comments about your wife. In the second, you have made four related comments from which I can draw a larger idea, and then continue to think about that idea. This impetus to think further is, as I have said before, the major reason for drawing inferences in the first place. A grouping of ideas like the plan­ ning and control system characteristics above does not push your thinking upward, and therefore cannot guide it forward on this particular subject. === Page 165 === QUESTIONING THE SUMMARY STATEMENT Visualize the relationships How you actually draw an inference from a proper grouping is a bit diffi­ cult to explain with precision. You have assembled in your grouping a collectively exhaustive class of observations about a subject, and you now want to make a statement about the class as a whole. Essentially the statement should give an insight into the implications of their being similar in the way they are. Achieving that insight requires a so­ called inductive leap. The springboard for that leap is likely to be a visualization of the source of the relationships reflected in the grouping. Let's look again at the first two examples in the",

The first group said that the information: 1 Should be updated. 2 Is now necessary. 3 Should be gathered. 4 Is not adequate. 5 Is needed. They clearly fall into two distinct groups: those complaining that the infor­ mation does not exist (2, 3, and 5), and those complaining that the information exists but is not adequate (1 and 4). So we see that the list implies that there are two problems with the information system. Now, why these two problems and no others? What is the same about them that made the author instantly recognize them as problems that should be grouped together? Possibly because these defects indicate a use­ lessness for planning purposes. In that case, the point the author would state at the top would be: 'The planning system as presently set up produces information that is useless for planning purposes.' Why? Because either the information needed doesn't exist, or it exists but it's not adequate. The next one, on the automotive aftermarket, is a bit harder. Again, the ideas fell into two groupings: • Positive points: large, growing, attractive, profitable, favourable trends, attractive • Negative points: barriers to entry, uncertainties, fragmented. Clearly if the market is large, growing, and profitable, it is attractive. And favourable trends also means it's attractive. Let's visualize this attractive market with a circle, as shown in Exhibit 49. 153 === Page 166 === 154 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Exhibit 49 The market is difficult to enter Only some parts of the market are attractive The negative points don't group so easily. Fragmented means that the circle must have some segments in it, but uncertainties obscure some seg­ ments' outlooks. This means some of the segments must look different from the others. Finally, he says there are barriers to getting in, so let's show that with a line stopping entry. Now what conclusions can we come to from the visualization? • Only some parts of the market are attractive. • These are going to be difficultto get into. That sounds like the beginning of a deductive argument. The author has left off the 'therefore' point, which means he never bothered to complete his thinking. No wonder he found it difficult to write a clear summary statement of the points. Sometimes you will be presented with groupings that look like situation ideas, but are really action ideas in disguise. Begin by treating",

For example, suppose you read: There are fourvariables to be managed in the resource allocation process: • Sequence and timing of activities. • Definition of specific people's tasks. '\" Definition of information needs. (content and form). • Decision-making process. -~~,~ ! === Page 167 === QUESTIONING THE SUMMARY STATEMENT Why these four variables and no others? What is the same about them that made him group them together? If you try to state them more specifically, so as to find an order, you will see that the author is probably saying this: The four variables are: • Spelling out the sequence and timing of project planning activities. • Specifying where decisions are needed. • Identifying who will participate in making them. • Defining the information they need to do so. These have now become a clear series of actions. Why would I want to take these four actions? What would be the effect? I suppose it would be to fix it so that everybody who should participate does so, and does so properly. The summarizing point then might be: The major management task in the resource allocation process is to ensure early and substantial participation of the proper people. Similarly, suppose you went on to say: Definition of content and form of information is often critical: • Determines what information is generated -and used. • Broadens perspective of participants. • Focuses attention on key issues. • Facilitates collaboration across functional and divisional lines. Again you question. Why these four reasons and no others? What is the same about them that makes the author bring them together? You would then note that the last three have to do with the behavior of the participants, while the first one is in a way saying the same thing as the point at the top. Then why the three and no others? Perhaps he means to be saying this: Defining what information is needed and how it should be presented can be critical to gaining agreement and understanding: • Focuses the participants' attention on key issues. • Broadens their perspective. ,.

How do you judge whether you've been sufficiently precise? In general, if you can think of as many points outside the group as in the group to which the overall statement could apply, you will know that it is not suffi­ ciently precise to serve as a valid inference about the grouping. The example below from Chapter 3 falls in this category: .. Composing room costs may represent a profit-improvement opportunity: Low productivity. High overtime. Uncompetitive prices for. simple jobs. If I see a company that has low productivity, high overtime, and uncom­ petitive prices, I can infer that here is a profit-improvement opportunity. However, I can substitute three other points (e.g., high scrap yield, poor timekeeping, undisciplined systems) and still infer that there is a profit­ improvement opportunity. The point at the top is too broad to make a statement about these three points and no others. Here's another imprecise example, this time properly inductive in form: • Japanese films are now escalating their drive for the Chinese market The Toyota Motor Compciny sent official representatives to the Canton trade fair. Japan Air Lines is negotiating to fly into China. What about Mitsubishi, or Hitachi, or half a dozen others that come to mind? Two examples do not justify a generalization about all Japanese firms. By contrast: • The doctrinal dispute between China and Russia is still very much alive. Hostile rhetoric is flying between Peking and Moscow. Both countries are deploying troops along the border. === Page 169 === QUESTIONING THE SUMMARY STATEMENT Here the class term is 'indications of a dispute,' and it is difficult to think of anything other than outright war that would rightfully belong in the class. Thus, the question raised in the reader's mind by the general state­ ment will be sufficiently answered by the two points below. The message to take away from this discussion is that you cannot simply group together a set of ideas and assume your reader will under­ stand their significance. Every grouping implies an overall point that reflects the nature of the relationship between the ideas in the grouping. You should first define that relationship",

Always ask yourself of any group, 'Why have I brought together these particular ideas and no others?' The answer will be either that they all fall into the same narrowly defined category, and are the only ideas that do fall into that category, in which case your summary point will be a state­ ment about their sameness. Or that they are all the actions that must be taken together to achieve a desired effect, so that the summary point states what that effect is. You should force yourself to justify each grouping of ideas in this way, so that you are sure that your thinking is dead clear and that your writing reflects it. 157 === Page 170 === '\"\"$~ ;t~ === Page 171 === Putting it into readable words You will recall I said at the very beginning of this book that writing any­ thing clearly consists of two steps: first decide the point you want to make, then put it into words. Once you have worked out your pyramid structure and rechecked the thinking in your groupings, you know exactly the points you want to make. You also know the order in which you want to make them. All that remains' is for you to put them into words. In theory this should be a relatively easy task. One ought to be able to expect the normal business writer to translate his pyramided points into a series of concise, graceful sentences and paragraphs that clearly convey a lively message and capture the reader's interest. Alas, it does not always happen. The average sentence, far from being concise and graceful, is long-winded and heavy with jargon. This makes the paragraphs seem impenetrable and the subject endlessly boring.

'! : ~ 159 === Page 172 === 160 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE These passages were produced by bright, articulate people with excellent problem-solving skills. Any one of them can explain his ideas orally and be completely comprehensible. But they appear to believe that, in writing, the more dehydrated the style and the more technical the jargon, the more respect it will command. This is nonsense. Good ideas ought not to be dressed up in bad prose. Works on technical subjects can at the same time be works of literary art, as the William Jameses, the Freuds, the Whiteheads, the Russells, and the Bronowskis of the world have proved. Of course technical communications addressed to specialists must employ technical language. But overloading it with jargon and employing a tortuous and cramped style is largely a matter of fashion, not of necessity. Your objective should be to dress your ideas in a prose that will not only communicate them clearly, but also give people pleasure in the process of absorbing them. This, of course, is advice that every book on writing gives, and if it were easy to do, everyone would be doing it. It is not easy to do, but there is a technique that can help. What it primarily requires is that you con­ sciously visualize the images you used in thinking up your ideas originally. As must be obvious by now, you do all your conceptual thinking in images rather than in words. It is more efficient to do so. An image can take a great mass of facts and synthesize them into a single abstract con­ figuration. Given the inability to think about more than seven or eight items at one time, it is a great convenience to be able to compress the world in this way. Without it you would always be limited to taking deci­ sions on the basis of a few low-level facts. But bring together instead seven or eight of these abstract concepts, and you have in front of you an enormous amount of complex detail that you can easily manipulate mentally. Look, for example, at how much more quickly you can grasp the relationships of these three lines to each other from the image than you can from the words: A A is longer than B B B is longer than C c-Therefore, A",

Once you have the image, you simply copy it into words. The reader, in turn, will re-create this image from your words, thereby not only grasping your thinking but also enjoying the exercise. === Page 173 === PUTTING IT INTO READABLE WORDS Let me demonstrate this process, first by showing how easily images appear when you are reading well-written prose, and then by giving you some hints on how to find the images lurking in bad prose so that you can rewrite it. Create the image . Here 1s a passage from Thoreau's Walden. As you read it, try to keep track of what's going on in your mind. \\;:' ;.­ ~~:.._ i· ;_,~'' , .. iF~~ ;,,,-·~- :\",, ~~P1-it~Wfrf9'.~11~·\"s,a~~~~~~~~:~~'.;f~!r:;:\\.:,z:~~~'·/::';;}:~··_ .,\";~:,0:c•-········.·· ··---··· As you took in the words, did you not build up a sort of mental picture in your mind, to which you added details as you took in successive phrases and sentences? What you were building was an image, but not a photographic image. Rather it is what George Miller, to whom I am indebted for this example,* calls a 'memory image,' and it grows piecemeal as you go along. If you read it as I did, first you see that it's March 1845, so that perhaps you have a feeling of a gray day in the past. Then you see one person borrow an axe from a second person, both indistinct, and you see him walking toward the woods, axe in hand. The trees turn into white pines, and you see Thoreau chopping at them. The next sentence introduced a hillside, so that suddenly the trees are on a hill. Then you see Thoreau stand up straight and look across at the pond, the open field, and the ice. Your experience may or may not have been exactly like that. The point is, however, that you were constructing the passage as you read. The result of this constructive activity is a memory image that summarizes the information presented. You construct the image as part of the process of understanding, and the image then helps you to remember what you have read. * From 'Images and Models, Similes and Metaphors,' in Metaphor and Thought.

But if you recall the image you can read off from it what you see, and it will be roughly equivalent to the original. That images help to increase recall has been proven in memory studies, although these studies also show that people forget some details and embellish others, depending on their emotional predilections. Nevertheless, the memory image does provide a record of the passage and of the information extracted from it - a record that the reader constructs as he reads, phrase by phrase. This is the kind of thing that must happen every time you read anything if you are to comprehend and remember it. Some passages are more diffi­ cult to visualize than others, and if the ideas being presented are particularly abstract, it may be that you will represent them with skeletal structures rather than with images. But unless the passage can be visual­ ized in some form, unless the reader can actually 'see' what is being said, he cannot be considered to have understood it. To demonstrate, here is a passage from a document that debated whether the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development should change from a fixed lending rate to a floating one. If the risk allowances provided in the lending rate spread turn ou.t to be too high, the Bank's income will be returned to borrowers as a group through a reduction in the lending rate in subsequent periods. Thus, fixed rate lending would involve extra costs for borrowers as a group only if the Bank were systematically to overestimate risks and thereby earn 'excess' income more or less permanently. This possibility seems remote. Although the concepts discussed are fairly abstract, words like 'spread,' 'excess,' and 'reduction' permit you to visualize a clear set of relationships. If asked to draw them, you could do so with no more than four lines and two arrows, perhaps like this. (I have added the words, but you would not need do so for yourself.) === Page 175 === PUTTING IT INTO READABLE WORDS This skeletal nature of the image is important to note. One does not want a complete, detailed photographic reproduction, but only a sense of the structure of the relationships being discussed. These will generally consist of one or",

It may seem almost childish as you look at it. But all the great 'visual thinkers' of the past who have talked about it, from Einstein on down, have emphasized this vague, hazy, abstract nature of their conscious visual imagery. Copy the image in words . . . Using JUSt these basics to create images can make a very great difference to rewriting bad prose. Let me demonstrate this using the first example on page 159. Because the words as laid out fail to call to mind an image as you read, your mind gropes in vain for something solid to hang onto. Look at the beginning of that first sentence again. \" A primary area • of potential improvement e is improving cost-effectiveness • of field sales-force deployment (and organization) By the time the field sales force arrives, the rest has disappeared from your mind. But the sentence goes on: \" to reflect the need \" for redefined selling missions <:> at store and indirect levels \" dictated by changes in the trade environment. Now, what nouns do we have to hang onto here that are relatively con­ crete? The sales force, store, and changed trade environment, perhaps. How might they be pictured in relationship to each other? 163 === Page 176 === 164 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE New environment Store Salesman This seems to indicate that the main relationship being talked about is that of the salesman to the store. Perhaps he meant to say: • We must redeploy the sales force to match the new trading environment. As you can see, the trick is to find the nouns and look for the relationships between them, seeing them as a visual image. Let's apply the technique to the other two examples on page 159. • Preplanned adjustments may be developed from the alternative preliminary plans submitted by the Group and be in the form of outlines of contingency plans and prioritized guides to adjustments in special programs and other discretionary expenditures. Again, the nouns seem to be 'preplanned adjustments,' 'alternative pre­ liminary plans,' and 'outlines of contingency plans and prioritized guides' (whatever that means). How might the author mean them to relate to each other? Alternative plans Preplanned adjustments Contingency plan 1. 2.",

In which case he might want to express his message like this: === Page 177 === PUTTING IT INTO READABLE WORDS • Outline the order in which activities will be curtailed should the plan need adjusting, One more example: • Current needs for accurate cash flow analyses are particularly demanding upon the existing system; it is not prepared to meet the stringent accuracy requirements. Improvements are available through incorporating information not adequately considered in making projections. Right off, of course, we can object that it is not the system that is not pre­ pared to meet the stringent accuracy requirements. However, to apply our process, the nouns appear to be 'inaccurate cash flow analyses,' 'system,' 'improvements' and 'information.' Might they go together in this way? SYSTEM ,,____I -·I '~' I I SYSTEM J Accurate i )> analysis The key insight to be gained from the image is apparently that insertion of the proper information will yield accurate analyses, giving us perhaps: • The system can produce accurate cash flow analyses if we feed X kind of information into if. (Without access to the author, we cannot judge what he means by 'Information not adequately considered in making projections.') To summarize, then, a useful way to help yourself write lucid prose is to force yourself to visualize the relationships inherent in your ideas. Once you have a clear mental image, you can straightaway translate it into a clear English sentence, which your reader can just as straightforwardly interpret and absorb. And he has the additional advantage of being able to store this knowledge in his memory in image form. 165 === Page 178 === 166 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Storing knowledge in image form is, of course, essential given the word-by-word process of reading and our limited ability to hold many words in our minds. By rescuing the image from the words, the reader is able not only to transfer the knowledge in large chunks, which are more efficient for his mind to process, but also to transfer it as a vivid impres­ sion, which makes it easier to recall.

No matter how large or how involved the subject, it can be communicated only in that way. You see, then, what an obligation we owe to him of order and arrangement -and why, apart from felicities and curiosities of diction, the old rhetorician laid such stress upon order and arrangement as duties we owe to those who honor us with their attention.' Go thou and do likewise. === Page 179 === Problem solving in structureless situations Chapter 8 characterizes problem solving as a relentlessly logical process for discovering and displaying the underlying structures that give rise to events we consider undesirable. Our theory has been that the solution of the problem will always lie in tinkering with the structure as indeed it will if the problem is that we do not like the result the structure is yielding. However as I mentioned, there is another kind of problem situation where the problem is not that you don't like the result but rather that you can't explain it. You can't explain it for one of three reasons: \" Because the structure does not yet exist -as when you are trying to invent something new (e.g., the telephone, underwater tunnelling) • Because the structure is invisible -as in the brain or DNA, so that you have only the results of the structure to analyze \" Because the structure fails to explain the result -as when Aristotle's definition of force did not explain the momentum of a cannonball, or when tools rust mysteriously no matter what you do to guard against it. It is possible that you may confront one of these structureless situations in the course of an ordinary problem-solving assignment. Although such sit­ uations require a higher level of visual thinking than we have been discussing, you will be pleased to know that the reasoning process employed is very similar. What is required is simply another form of Abduction -a name coined by Charles Sanders Peirce in 1890 to describe the process of problem solv­ ing. In calling it Abduction he hoped to emphasize the affinity of problem-solving thinking with Deduction and Induction. Let me explain the difference between the two forms of Abduction, and show you how to use the second. 167 === Page 180 === 168",

      "content": "CONTEXT: Barbara Minto - Pyramid principle HQ.pdf - Part 131\n\nTHE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE Analytical abduction C. S. Peirce's insight was that in any reasoning process you always deal with three distinct entities: • A R.ule (a belief about the way the world is structured) e. A Case (an observed fact that exists in the world) • A Result (an expected occurrence, given the application of the Rufe in this Case). The way in which you can consider yourself to be reasoning at any one time is determined by where you start in the process and what additional fact you know. To illustrate the differences: Deduction Rule: If we put the price too high, sales will go down. Case: We have put the price too high. Result Therefore, sales will go down. Induction Case: Result: Rule: We have put the price up. Sales have gone down. The reason sales have gone down is probably that the price was too high. Abduction Result: Sales have gone down. Rule: One reason sales go down is that the price is too high. Case: Let me check whether in fact the price is too high. If A then B A Necessarily B A B If A then probably B If A then B Possibly A We have been saying throughout that analytical problem solving consists of noticing an undesirable Result, looking for its cause in our knowledge of the structure of the situation (Rule) and testing whether we have found it (Case). You can see that this exactly matches the Abductive reasoning process shown above. === Page 181 === PROBLEM SOLVING IN STRUCTURELESS SITUATIONS Even though Abduction is different from Induction and Deduction - and it is important to note the difference -they are also closely related. Thus, in any complex problem-solving situation you are likely to be using all three forms of reasoning in rotation. As I said earlier, the form you are using, and the results you can expect from it, depend on where you start in the process. Where you start determines the form of thinking you will use.

In reasoning to the third, the scientist follows the classical scientific method: • Hypothesize a structure that could explain the result. • Devise an experiment that will confirm or exclude the hypothesis. • Carry out the experiment to get a clear yes-or-no answer. • Recycle the procedure, making subhypotheses or sequential hypotheses to define the possibilities that remain, and so on. The hallmarks of the scientific method are generating hypotheses and devising experiments. Both activities demand high levels of visual thinking. 169 === Page 182 === 70 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE 1 Generating hypotheses. The hypotheses are drawn out of the air, but are directly suggested by examining the structural elements of the situation that produced the problem. For example, if your problem is that you want to find a way to permit people to communicate over long distances without shouting, then you will be thinking specifically about ways to magnify the voice or amplify the ear, and your hypotheses will reflect the possibilities you envision. Exactly how you go about envisioning productive possibilities is, unfortu­ nately, not something one can spell out in a recipe. It frequently requires a kind of genius that permits you to see analogies between what you know of the problem and what you know of the world. And indeed this is what Alexander Graham Bell apparently did in inventing the telephone: 'It struck me thatthe bones of the human ear were very massive, indeed, as compared with the delicate thin membrane that operated them, and the thought occurred that ifa membrane so delicate could move bones relatively so massive, why should not a thicker and stouter piece of membrane move my piece of steel.' Clearly, we touch the tip of a very big iceberg here. No one knows what makes an apt analogy occur to one person and not to another. Certainly having total knowledge of the problem situation helps, as does spelling out and re-examining all your assumptions about it. What we do know from those who have written about the process, however, is that their insight when arrived at is always a visual image. 2 Devising experiments. Once the hypothesis is formulated, the next step is to use it to suggest experiments that will confirm or deny it. Again, visual thinking is required to",

Let me set up an experiment to prove conclusively that in fact it does follow.' To put it in terms of the Abductive process: Result: Rule: Case: I observe the unexpected fact A. · A may be so because B is the case. If B were the case, then C would follow as a matter of course. Let me check whether C does in fact follow. === Page 183 === PROBLEM SOLVING IN STRUCTURELESS SITUATIONS We can see the process very easily in the story of Galileo and the cannonball. Result: Aristotle says that force is that which produces velocity. From this it follows that when a force ceases to act on a body, the body should cease to move. Yet if I shoot a ball from a cannon, the ball continues to move even though the force has stopped. Aristotle must be wrong in his conc:eption of force as it relates to motion. Rule: I can observe the relationship between motion and force simply by dropping a ball from my hand. When I do so I notice that the situation contains three structural elements: The weight of the ball. The distance through which it falls. The time through whic:h it falls. This suggests three different hypotheses: Force is proportional to the weight of the body on which the force acts. Force is proportional to the distance through which the body moves when the force acts. Force is proportional to the time through which the force acts. Case: If hypothesis 3 is true, then the distance covered would be proportional to the square of the time. This means that if a body covers one unit of distance in one unit of time, it must cover four units of distance in two units of time, nine units of distance in three units of time, etc. Let me roll a ball down the side of an inclined plane. This will slow up its fall sufficiently for me to measure the distances covered in different units of time, and thus determine whether the relation between distance and time is the one prescribed by my hypothesis. New It is the same. Therefore force is that which produc:es Rule: change of velocity. 171 === Page 184 === 172 THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE The trick in structuring an experiment is to make sure",

It is not enough 'to see what happens' if you change one or another of the conditions in the situation. The result of the experiment must allow you to state unequivocally whether you will keep or discard the hypothesis. It is in the sciences that have most rigorously applied this particular requirement that the greatest advances in our knowledge have occurred over the last 50 years. To quote Charles Darwin, 'How odd it is that anyone should not see that all observations must be for or against some view, if they are to be of any service.' To bring this discussion to a close, I have set out both forms of Abduction on the next page. As you can see, they follow a common pat­ tern. It is a pattern that can be of enormous value in guiding you to produce rapid breakthroughs in thinking about and resolving problems. Its value lies in the fact that it forces your thinking forward in a rigorous way, in the minimum sequence of steps, without dawdling or getting tied up in irrelevancies. Each step demands a clear end product that you can literally see; each image indicates the direction in which the subsequent analyses should lead. When the problem has been solved, the images serve as anchors to guide the course of your discussion and the choice of your words. Herb Simon says that solving a problem simply means representing it so as to make the solution transparent. I have striven to give you an under­ standing of the process by which such representations can most efficiently be created and utilized. We are all probably capable of thinking far more creatively and efficiently than we attempt. Clearer knowledge of the process involved might influence us to try. === Page 185 === PROBLEM SOLVING IN STRUCTURELESS SITUATIONS Techniques of Problem Solving Basic Process Analytical Problem Solving Scientific Problem Solving 1 .

CRAFTING A JOB: REVISIONING EMPLOYEES AS ACTIVE CRAFTERS OF THEIR WORK AMY WRZESNIEWSKI New York University JANE E. DUTTON University of Michigan We propose that employees craft their jobs by changing cognitive, task, and/or rela- tional boundaries to shape interactions and relationships with others at work. These altered task and relational configurations change the design and social environment of the job, which, in turn, alters work meanings and work identity. We offer a model of job crafting that specifies (1) the individual motivations that spark this activity, (2) how opportunities to job craft and how individual work orientations determine the forms job crafting takes, and (3) its likely individual and organizational effects. Organizational researchers care about what what composes the experience of a job. Tradi- tionally, they have focused on either individual determinants (Dubin, 1956; Lodahl & Kejner, 1965; Roberson, 1990), such as expectations or values, or external characteristics of the job it- self (Griffin, 1987; Hackman & Oldham, 1980), such as work tasks or social interaction at work. Both perspectives minimize the role that em- ployees play in actively shaping both the tasks and social relationships that compose a job. Even in the most restricted and routine jobs, employees can exert some influence on what is the essence of the work. The core premise of this article is that the work tasks and interactions that",

In our perspective we draw on assumptions of social constructionism that \"place particular stress on the individual's psy- chological construction of the experiential world\" (Gergen, 1994: 67). The social context pro- vides employees with the materials they use to build the experience of work (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978). Interactions with others help employees define and bound tasks by shaping impressions of what is and is not part of the job. However, job boundaries, the meaning of work, and work identities are not fully determined by formal job requirements. Individuals have latitude to de- fine and enact the job, acting as \"job crafters.\" We define job crafting as the physical and cog- nitive changes individuals make in the task or relational boundaries of their work. Thus, job crafting is an action, and those who undertake it are job crafters. Our perspective illuminates how, when, and why employees are likely to craft their jobs, and how crafting revises both employees' work identities and work meanings. An employee's job is made up of a \"set of task elements grouped together under one job title and designed to be performed by a single indi- vidual\" (Ilgen & Hollenbeck, 1992: 173). Thus, tasks represent the most basic building blocks of the relationship between employees and the organization (Griffin, 1987) and are composed of \"the set of prescribed work activities a person normally performs during a typical work period\" (Griffin, 1987: 94). Crafting a job involves shap- ing the task boundaries of the job (either physi- cally or cognitively), the relational boundaries of the job, or both. Changing task boundaries means altering the form or number of activities one engages in while doing the job, whereas changing cognitive task boundaries refers to al- tering how one sees the job (e.g., as a set of We thank the William Russell Kelly Chair for its financial support of this work.

By changing any one of these elements, an individual alters the design of the job and the social environment in which he or she works. We argue that such actions affect both the meaning of the work and one's work identity. By \"meaning of the work\" we mean individuals' understandings of the purpose of their work or what they believe is achieved in the work (Brief & Nord, 1990). The meaning of work is reflected in the framing of the work more generally (e.g., a physician may frame work as being about heal- ing people or about acting upon illness with technology, among other possibilities; Hughes, 1971; Terkel, 1974). By \"work identity\" we mean how individuals define themselves at work. Work identity is partly cognitive: it describes the attributes and the more holistic conception that people have of themselves at work. At the same time, individuals make claims about what work is and what it is not, making work identity a set of actions as well as a set of cognitions (Bartel & Dutton, in press; Creed & Scully, in press; Guild, 1999; Van Maanen, 1998). While identity cannot be changed at will, individuals make claims about who they are and why what they do mat- ters, and this is part of the social identity that is created at work (Ashforth & Mael, 1989). Work identification, like organizational identification, assumes correspondence between how individ- uals define themselves and how they define their work (Pratt, 1998). What individuals do at work and who they interact with are two important means by which employees change their work identities. For ex- ample, when a hospital cleaner changes the job by cutting tasks and avoiding interaction with others, the meaning of the job and the identity of the employee change as well. Clearly, changing the meaning of work informs and is informed by one's work identity, or by being the person who accomplishes these purposes. The meaning of work and one's work identify are core ingredi- ents in the creation of a job over time. Changes in one's framing of the work's purpose by defi- nition changes the meaning of the work, which, in",

For example, when an internet ser- vice provider changes the framing of the work from being about making sales to being about connecting those who would otherwise be left behind in the computing revolution, the mean- ing of the work changes, as does the employee's identity (deal maker versus champion of the masses). In this article we construe employees as \"job crafters,\" and we use the term job crafting to capture the actions employees take to shape, mold, and redefine their jobs. Job crafters are individuals who actively compose both what their job is physically, by changing a job's task boundaries, what their job is cognitively, by changing the way they think about the relation- ships among job tasks, and what their job is relationally, by changing the interactions and relationships they have with others at work. Job crafting is a psychological, social, and physical act, in which cues are read about physical boundaries of the work and are interpreted by motivated crafters. Job crafters act upon the task and relational boundaries of the job, changing their identity and the meaning of the work in the process. In doing so, job crafters create different jobs for themselves, within the context of de- fined jobs. Thus, job crafting is a creative and improvised process that captures how individu- als locally adapt their jobs in ways that create and sustain a viable definition of the work they do and who they are at work. Whether this craft- ing is \"good\" or \"bad\" for the organization is an issue that is situationally dependent. We offer a model of job crafting that specifies (1) the individual motivations that spark this activity, (2) how opportunities to job craft and how individual work orientations help to deter- mine the forms job crafting takes, and (3) its likely individual and organizational effects. Job crafting is a situated activity, in the sense that different contexts enable or disable different levels and forms of crafting. Because job craft- ing is related to similar concepts in the organi- zational literature, we contrast job crafting and its contribution to these concepts. In addition, we provide several examples of job crafting, which bring to life two aspects of job crafting: (1) employees construct their work worlds by shaping the tasks that compose the job, and (2) employees form interactions and",

Job alterations can be incremental or radical-visible or invis- ible.

Similarly, when an overworked employee re- duces the scope and scale of work activities to prevent exhaustion, this is a form of job crafting. Ilgen and Hollenbeck (1992) define such job changes as emergent task elements, but they separate this idea from the job itself, instead naming these changes as part of the employee's new role. Thus, in their view, jobs do not change as a result of job crafting; we, however, contend that the job (and its tasks), its meaning, and employee identity all change when job crafting occurs. Although a dominant focus in studies of work has been on understanding the connection between employees' ratings of their jobs and objective job properties, we argue for a perspec- tive that acknowledges the everyday altering of jobs that individuals do. Therefore, there is no \"objective\" job to which to compare employees' perceptions. Instead, the job is being re-created or crafted all the time. Also, job crafting differs from job design (Hackman & Oldham, 1980) in that it addresses the processes by which em- ployees change elements of their jobs and rela- tionships with others to revise the meaning of the work and the social environment at work. In contrast, the job design perspective focuses on employees' experiences of jobs in which task elements are more static. Job design perspectives are largely concerned with determining how employees interpret ob- jective task characteristics and social informa- tion in the job setting to produce attitudinal and motivational responses to the work (Griffin & McMahan, 1994; Ilgen & Hollenbeck, 1992). Job crafting complements theories of job design by essentially changing the direction of this rela- tionship; instead of the design of the job elicit- ing attitudes and motivation, the opportunity and motivation to craft elicit job crafting. Rather than assume that employees who are satisfied in their work will take on more job tasks, as those with the job",

Our discussion of job crafting proceeds in three steps. First, we present our model of job crafting, followed by an account of how job craft- ing differs from related constructs and how it builds upon a subset of these to portray the motivations for and effects of crafting a job. Sec- ond, we offer six examples from organizational research of job crafters in action to enliven our model. Third, we discuss how our model contrib- utes to organizational research, offer practical implications, and suggest areas for future re- search. JOB CRAFTING In Figure 1 we present our job crafting model -built on the premise that the motivation to job craft and the perceived opportunities present within the organization to engage in crafting act in concert to affect the form and extent of job crafting. More formally, we argue that the moti- vation to craft a job is moderated by the perceived opportunity to do so, as well as by individuals' work and motivational orientations. Thus, situational and dispositional conditions moderate how motivation to craft creates job crafting patterns. We outline the contours for a general framework of job crafting in Figure 1. Motivation for Job Crafting The motivation for job crafting arises from three individual needs. First, employees engage in job crafting to assert some control over their jobs in order to avoid alienation from the work (Braverman, 1974). Second, employees are moti- vated to create a positive self-image in their work. Third, job crafting allows employees to fulfill a basic human need for connection to oth- ers (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). We consider each motivation below. The need for personal control is a basic hu- man drive. Humans respond well to having con- trol even over seemingly small matters, and con- trol in one's own environment has been described as \"an intrinsic necessity of life itself\" (Adler, 1930: 398). Thus, one would expect that having or taking control over certain aspects of the work would be a basic human need. The implications of having little control over one's work are even more profound; the hallmarks of alienating work are having little or no control over the tasks of, conditions for, or overall pur- pose of the work (Braverman, 1974; Rogers, 1995).

People also desire to create and sustain a positive sense of self in their own eyes (Steele, 1988) and in the eyes of others (Baumeister, 1982; Erez & Earley, 1993). The drive for self-enhance- ment through construction of a positive self- image is a basic tenet of social identity theory (e.g., Tajfel, 1981, 1982) and is reflected in the drive to create positive images of self in work (Dutton, Dukerich, & Harquail, 1994). When the jobs that people have make this positive con- struction of self difficult, they (and people in general) are motivated to remedy the situation. For example, Roger (1995) describes how tempo- rary workers change the pace of the work, as well as their names, while working in temporary jobs to separate negative impressions of temp work from the positive image they have of them- selves as people. Goffman's (1956) focus on def- erence and demeanor illustrates the range of actions people engage in to create a positive impression of themselves in the eyes of others. This pressure to create a positive image infil- trates many aspects of employees' work activi- ties. Accordingly, one important motive for job crafters is to change the tasks and relationships that compose their jobs to enable a more posi- tive sense of self to be expressed and confirmed by others. The third motivation for job crafting concerns a need for human connection. Human beings are motivated to forge connections with others as a way to introduce meaning into their lives (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). Most theories of the meaning of work are individually based (Brief & Nord, 1990), but we extend this view by showing that employees build relationships with others at work to",

For example, when hospi- tal cleaners integrate themselves into patient care functions, they are able to see their work as being about healing people and to see them- selves as a key part of this process, thus enhanc- ing work meaning and creating a more positive work identity (e.g., worker as healer instead of cleaner). Through these kinds of changes, em- ployees narrate a different sense of who they are at work (Gergen & Gergen, 1988) and why the work matters. By altering their jobs, they fulfill prescribed work tasks but craft the job into something fundamentally different at the same time. The job crafting motivations we describe com- plement other perspectives on the role of need fulfillment in jobs. For example, employees with high growth-need strength (Hackman & Old- ham, 1980) are likely to respond well to changes that expand their jobs. However, we suggest that those with high growth-need strength will craft boundaries for themselves, rather than re- spond positively to task boundaries that are ex- panded for them, in order to respond to their own motivation and opportunity to craft in the job. Thus, job crafting addresses a set of practices and dynamics quite different from theories of job design. Not all employees are motivated to fulfill needs for control, positive image, and connec- tion at work. Individuals who look to fulfill these needs at work likely will look for opportunities to craft their jobs in ways that allow them to meet their needs. Others may find that these needs are met elsewhere in their lives. Likewise, when employees work in jobs that fulfill their needs for control, positive image, and connec- tion, they may not be motivated to job craft, since their needs are met by their current work situation (Caldwell & O'Reilly, 1990). Motivation to craft a job most often will result from situa- tions in which employees feel that their needs are not being met in their job as it is currently designed. Perceived Opportunities for Job Crafting Motivation to craft a job is more likely to spark job crafting when employees perceive that op- portunities for job crafting exist. Perceived op- portunity to craft a job refers to the sense of freedom or discretion employees have in what they do in their job and how they do it. Like other opportunity perceptions, opportunities to",

Thus, motivated employ- ees are likely to assess opportunities for job crafting at work before crafting their jobs. Fol- lowing this, perceived opportunity for job craft- ing moderates the relationship between motiva- tion to job craft and job crafting behaviors; perceived opportunities for job crafting can re- strict or open up possibilities for employees to This content downloaded from 195.34.79.223 on Thu, 12 Jun 2014 21:06:32 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions === Page 7 === 184 Academy of Management Review April see what paths are available in how they enact their jobs. Our model sets forth two major contributors to the perceived opportunity to craft a job, both of which are tied to the actual design of work: (1) the level and form of task interdependence and (2) the level of discretion or freedom to job craft implied by monitoring systems in the job. In any organization, employee tasks are car- ried out with more or less task interdependence built into the work. Task interdependence refers to \"the extent to which the items or elements upon which work is performed or the work pro- cesses themselves are interrelated so that changes in the state of one element affect the state of the others\" (Scott, 1987: 214). Employees engaged in tasks with higher degrees of inter- dependence (e.g., approximating reciprocal as opposed to pooled interdependence; Thompson, 1967) are yoked more strongly to the timing and tasks of others, restricting the degree of possible task alterations, how the employees perform tasks, and with whom they interact along the way. Thus, those with more task interdepen- dence work under more constraints and have less freedom to alter task and relational bound- aries as a result. In effect, the more task inter- dependence an employee has, the fewer de- grees of freedom he or she has to job craft. In contrast, an employee with job tasks that re- quire little task interdependence with coworkers (e.g., hairdresser, cleaning staff member) has more latitude to alter the task and relational boundaries of the job. Thus, we expect that less interdependence with coworkers creates more freedom for crafting, enhancing the perceived opportunity",

In jobs in which managers closely control employee tasks and time (e.g., customer service agent, telemar- keter), job crafting is likely to be both high in visibility and less welcomed. When employees work \"out of the limelight\" of management's gaze, they may perceive more opportunities to be creative in crafting their jobs (Amabile, Hill, Hennessey, & Tighe, 1994). We argue that when employees' jobs are explicitly defined and con- trolled, employees may see less opportunity for crafting activities. This point offers a contrast with a job design perspective, in which it is assumed that autonomy in the work leads to enhanced meaning in the work and felt respon- sibility for the job. Instead, we assert that auton- omy in the job leads to perceived opportunities for job crafting and encourages employees to alter the task and relational boundaries of their jobs. This argument suggests that there are contra- dictory forces at play in the modern workplace that might affect crafting patterns. As technol- ogy enables organizations and supervision to be more controlling (e.g., by monitoring computer work, web usage, and e-mail traffic), these forces are likely to dampen perceived opportu- nities for job crafting. At the same time, how- ever, organizations are embracing less limiting practices, in which casual dress, flexible work hours, and flexible workplaces may accentuate perceived opportunities to job craft. These boundary conditions are meant to be suggestive about conditions that might encourage moti- vated employees to job craft. Work and Motivational Orientations and Job Crafting Individuals' orientations toward their work are likely to affect the relationship between mo- tivation to craft and job crafting behaviors. Re- search shows that most people have one of three distinct relations to their work, seeing it as a job, career, or calling (Bellah, Madsen, Sullivan, Swidler, & Tipton, 1985; Wrzesniewski, McCau- ley, Rozin, & Schwartz, 1997). The distinctions, drawn starkly, are these: people with jobs focus on financial rewards for working, rather than pleasure or fulfillment; those with careers focus primarily on advancement; and those with call- ings focus on enjoyment of fulfilling, socially useful work. Research indicates that employees in a wide range of occupations-from clerical to professional-see their work primarily in one of these three ways and that jobs, careers, and callings are each represented within occupa- tions",

Work orientations are likely to interact with motivation to job craft in encouraging or dis- couraging job crafting. Work orientations allow people to see different kinds of possibilities for how to change their tasks and relationships at work. Employees are likely to revise their jobs in ways that fit their work orientation, enacting the same jobs very differently.

Likewise, employees with career orientations are likely to craft their jobs so that they interact with and help those who are more powerful than them, and engage in high-visibility tasks that are good for the or- ganization. Employees' general motivational orientations may also affect job crafting (Amabile et al., 1994). Specifically, those with intrinsic (e.g., do- ing the work for its own sake) motivations for working may engage in more expansive job crafting, which will allow for the expression of self-determination (control) and competence in their work. In contrast, extrinsic (e.g., doing the work for a reason apart from the work itself) motivations for working may encourage job crafting that limits the task and relational boundaries of the job, since the work is done to meet some external end. Indeed, extrinsic moti- vation has been shown to produce rigid behav- ior and less creativity in approaching tasks (Amabile et al., 1994). While Amabile and col- leagues suggest that people may choose occu- pations based on their motivational orienta- tions, we suggest that, through job crafting, people will craft from within their jobs to meet their needs. Thus, job and individual features both moder- ate the relationship between motivation to job craft and job crafting behaviors. When job and individual features create conditions that are favorable for job crafting, more job crafting should result among employees who are moti- vated to job craft. We argue that employees who perceive limited opportunities to job craft or who are not motivated to craft will engage in less job crafting than those who are motivated or see opportunities.

Forms of Job Crafting In Table 1 we present three forms of job craft- ing. The first form involves changing the job's task boundaries. Employees achieve this by changing the number, scope, or type of job tasks done at work. By choosing to do fewer, more, or different tasks than prescribed in the formal job, employees create a different job. The second form of job crafting entails chang- ing the relational boundary of the job. This prac- tice involves changing either the quality or amount of interaction with others at work, or both. Employees often can decide how fre- quently they wish to interact with others on the job and can also help determine the quality of those interactions. The examples we offer later in the article highlight cases in which employ- ees change their level of involvement with oth- ers at work and alter the nature of these rela- tionships in ways that change the job. The third form of job crafting occurs when employees change the cognitive task bound- aries of their jobs. Changing the cognitive boundaries can take many forms, but one likely involves employees' altering how they parse the TABLE 1 Forms of Job Crafting Form Example Effect on Meaning of Work Changing number, scope, and type Design engineers engaging in relational Work is completed in a more timely of job tasks tasks that move a project to fashion; engineers change the completion meaning of their jobs to be guardians or movers of projects Changing quality and/or amount of Hospital cleaners actively caring for Cleaners change the meaning of interaction with others patients and families, integrating their jobs to be helpers of the encountered in job themselves into the workflow of their sick; see the work of the floor floor units unit as an integrated whole of which they are a vital part Changing cognitive task Nurses taking responsibility for all Nurses change the way they see boundaries information and \"insignificant\" tasks the work to be more about that may help them to care more patient advocacy, as well as appropriately for a patient high-quality technical care This content downloaded from 195.34.79.223 on Thu, 12 Jun 2014 21:06:32 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions === Page 9 === 186 Academy of Management",

Changing the view of the job in this way fundamentally changes how employees approach the job. For example, nurses who see their work as being about advocacy and total patient care, rather than the delivery of high-quality technical care, change the way they view the job and, as a result, engage in different job activities (Benner, Tanner, & Chesla, 1996). Johansson (1996) de- scribes a similar process, in which housing com- pany employees shifted the way they framed the work when the company delegated \"total re- sponsibility\" to its workers in caring for the building areas to which they were assigned. Effects of Job Crafting on the Job Crafter The effects of job crafting are outlined in Fig- ure 1. Following directly from the conditions en- couraging job crafting and the ways employees craft their jobs, the effects of job crafting are both specific and general; job crafting creates alterations in the meaning of the work, as well as revisions of work identity. Job crafting changes the meaning of the work by changing job tasks or relationships in ways that allow employees to reframe the purpose of the job and experience the work differently (Tausky, 1995). Psychological meaningfulness of work results when people feel worthwhile and valuable at work (Hackman & Oldham, 1980). Thus, any actions that employees take to alter their jobs in ways that increase feelings of pur- pose are likely change the meaning of the work. Creating or adding meaning to the work by job crafting is similar to the process Ashforth and Kreiner (1999) describe regarding how those in stigmatized occupations (e.g., involving \"dirty work\") transform the meaning of the work by refraiming the job. For example, public defend- ers claim they are \"protecting the constitutional rights of all citizens to a fair trial\" (1999: 421)- not helping criminals avoid condemnation. Sim- ilarly, Goffman (1974) describes regrounding, in which individuals perform an activity for rea- sons or motives that differ from other people's. This regrounding process helps employees to compose a different purpose for the work they are doing. In both cases, individuals reconstruct the job in ways that differ from its original struc- ture, and they craft a different purpose for the work that is believable for self and others. Job crafting also has the potential to shape",

People attempt to create social communities that support desir- able images of themselves (Schlenker, 1985). The people with whom one interacts on and off the job play a role in cocreating and sustaining the claims one makes about one's work identity. In Sampson's terms, others \"endow us with meaning and clothe us with comprehensibility\" (1993: 106). The basis of our argument is that people have some freedom in creating sustain- able work identities by selectively influencing the relational partners with whom they interact (Gergen, 1994; Schlenker, 1985). These relational partners, in turn, through talk and action, help to cocreate employees' work identities by reflect- ing back, or not (Cooley, 1902; Mead, 1934), ele- ments of this identity. Therefore, by shaping the form and amount of interaction with others at work, employees participate in the creation of their work identity with others and enable the creation of desirable identities that fulfill a need for positive self-assessment. Job crafters seek out relationships with others on the job who serve as audiences for which they can sustain desirable identities. The cre- ation of work identity is an active process, in which \"people strive to create environments, in both their own minds and the real world, that support, validate and elicit desirable identity images. They thus selectively encounter, per- ceive and influence the situations and audi- ences with which they deal\" (Schlenker, 1985: 89). As McCall and Simmons describe it, people create a self-confirming opportunity structure and then develop social environments that nur- ture their self-views (1966: 105). The work meanings and identities employees forge by job crafting are not static. Employees are likely to use these meanings and identities as feedback about their crafting activities, and they may be motivated to engage in additional job crafting to further shape the work meaning and work identity. For example, an employee who alters the task boundary of the job to en- hance control over the work might find that this practice changes the purpose of the work in un- expected ways, thus motivating the employee to craft the job in other ways. Thus, this employee may use the changed purpose of the work as feedback to guide more job crafting.

We argue that this activity serves the employee, but it is not inherently good or bad for organizations; employees may change the job in ways that benefit or hurt the organization while benefiting themselves. For example, car assembly line em- ployees who decide to make changes to their tasks might cause major problems in the flow and quality of work or, alternatively, might boost productivity and quality. Our framework implies that all employees are potential job crafters. We realize this argument might mislead people into thinking that employ- ees who are caught in jobs in which they find little meaning can choose to change their fate if they wish. We do not assume that all employees can and should engage in job crafting and, therefore, are to blame if their jobs are not meaningful. Rather, we choose to focus on the freedom employees have and the creativity they exhibit in crafting jobs to be different from their formally specified ingredients. In addition, we do not address the point that job crafting may create more work for the em- ployee, even though this work is voluntary. Job crafters are not necessarily recognized or re- warded for the effort they make to create more meaningful jobs; much of what they do may be invisible to managers, supervisors, and cowork- ers (Fletcher, 1998; Star & Strauss, 1999). Job crafters may engage in practices that benefit the organization, introducing innovation into tasks and the relationships that compose work. Yet, at the same time, by changing their jobs, job craft- ers' actions may put the organization at risk for legal or regulatory problems, or they may jeop- ardize the employees' capacities to perform the job well. However, as we argue, the rewards that employees can reap from job crafting are real and consequential. Linking Job Crafting to Related Constructs The idea that individuals can craft new jobs within the constraints of prescribed jobs is not entirely new. Building on Katz and Kahn's (1966) ideas of role innovation, Staw and colleagues argue that individuals engage in task revision (Staw & Boettger, 1990) and sculpting activities (Bell & Staw, 1989) that make a difference for the organization and the individual doing the job. For example, Raf aeli (1989)",

The cashiers in her study engaged in different practices to maintain control over service interactions with customers, such as ignoring, rejecting, reacting to, or en- gaging the customers in the transaction. Ilgen and Hollenbeck (1992) note that job holders cre- ate emergent task elements in their roles in or- ganizations and are most able to do this when the job has few formal requirements and allows employees to choose the work tasks to be under- taken. Despite these useful developments, the idea that employees actively design their jobs has not been studied in proportion to its importance to organizational studies. In some perspectives researchers do address similar phenomena to job crafting, but they often implicitly or explic- itly (e.g., Ilgen & Hollenbeck, 1992) assume that only those employees with a great deal of job autonomy or complexity can engage in such be- haviors. Other perspectives on work share some features with job crafting but differ in their fun- damental focus. In particular, job design (Hack- man & Oldham, 1980) and social information processing (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978) perspec- tives on work stand in contrast to job crafting but offer foundations on which crafting can be offered as a useful complement. The job design literature has historically been a central frame for understanding how individ- uals experience their jobs. Hackman and Old- ham (1976, 1980) and, earlier, Hackman and Lawler (1971) outlined a theoretical framework regarding how individuals judge their jobs to be motivating and satisfying by focusing on objec- tive task characteristics. According to this the- ory, job motivation is tied to objective features of the job, including skill variety, task identity and significance, autonomy, and feedback. Although support of the job characteristics model has been mixed (Glick, Jenkins, & Gupta, 1986; Hogan & Martell, 1987), it remains a dominant frame for understanding how employees expe- rience their jobs. The job design perspective puts managers in the role of job crafters: the managers design tasks and act as job crafters, altering the moti- vation and satisfaction of employees by chang- ing task features.

In this integrated model, features of the objective and subjective work environments affect job attitudes (Griffin, 1987, 1991; Griffin, Bateman, Wayne, & Head, 1987). Individuals play a role in filtering and reacting to job information, but in this literature re- searchers tend to portray them as passive par- ticipants in the process: \"lumps of clay, ready to be shaped by all those around them\" (Bell & Staw, 1989: 232). The job design perspective decouples inter- pretation of the job from the objective character- istics of the job itself, but there is still an as- sumption that the interpretation is based on the job as it was designed-not as the employee crafted it. Job crafting casts the employee in a more active light; those in the work environment (e.g., clients, coworkers) can help forge new work relationships that alter the boundaries of the job. More basically, job design assumes that employee responses derive from the motivating potential of the job; job crafting assumes that employees create this motivating potential by shaping elements that traditionally compose the design of the job (e.g., skill, significance, feedback). Our theory of job crafting builds on this social information processing perspective (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978) by identifying different predictors of how people enact their jobs. According to the social information processing model, social in- formation and cues from others act as inputs to the meaning of the work. However, this model does not account for the features in the context of the job (e.g., individual, task, and organiza- tional features) that shape how the work gets done. Our job crafting perspective builds on Salancik and Pfeffer's (1978) perspective in two ways. First, it complements the social informa- tion processing model by indicating that rather than simply interpreting and acting from the cues offered by the job and by others, individu- als are instead interpreting and using as feed- back the crafting actions they have taken in their own jobs. Second, our model explicitly ad- dresses the identity changes that accompany job crafting and the meaning that employees derive from the work by doing their work differ- ently. This is consistent with Salancik and Pfef- fer's",

Advocates of other perspec- tives on how individuals change job tasks or other job elements offer additional contrasts to job crafting. In particular, they predict how and when individuals are likely to alter their jobs. Below, we describe five different conceptual lenses on how jobs change, and we discuss how job crafting differs from each. Role and Individual Innovation Schein used role innovation to describe be- havior that represented a \"basic rejection of the norms which govern the practice of the profes- sion combined with a concern for the role of the professional in society\" (Schein, 1971: 522). Schein described role innovation behaviors that redefined who the professional's clients were, who initiated contact, what settings were appro- priate for contact with clients, and what the ap- propriate boundaries were of the professional's expertise. Later, Van Maanen and Schein de- fined role innovation as \"behaviors done to re- define the major premises concerning missions followed by the majority of the role occupants\" (1979: 229). Nicholson (1984), following Schein (1971), defined role innovation as the initiating of \"changes in task objectives, methods, materi- als, scheduling and in the interpersonal rela- tionships integral to task performance.\" (1984: 175). These changes are intended to match the role requirements to the needs, abilities, and identity of the employee. Job crafting theory resembles role innovation theory in that there is an assumption that em- ployees can act upon the job to create a better fit. However, as a lens on employee behavior, role innovation theory restricts individuals' ac- tions on the job to reactive, problem-solving be- haviors and fails to develop the individual focus we describe here. Rather than an emphasis on problem solving, in job crafting theory there is an emphasis on the proactive changes employ- ees make in the boundaries of their work to alter their identity or the meaning of the work. The job crafting model is also less formal than the model of role making proposed by Graen and Scandura (1987). In their model there is a proposed sequence of activities, from first shar- ing standard job elements and then adding This content downloaded from 195.34.79.223 on Thu, 12 Jun 2014 21:06:32 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions === Page 12 === 2001 Wrzesniewski and",

Our model of job crafting is more fluid than the role-making model, and we see the process as having a more improvisational than planful quality. A related research area involves individual innovation and creativity in organizations. His- torically, in such research scholars have focused on individual problem solving in organizations (Kanter, 1983; West & Farr, 1990). Much of the writing is intended for managers, with prescrip- tions for how to develop and select for innova- tion among employees. West and Farr offer a definition of innovation as \"the intentional in- troduction and application within a role, group, or organization of ideas, processes, products, or procedures, new to the relevant unit of adoption, designed to significantly benefit the individual, the group, organization or wider society\" (1990: 9). Although this definition is broad, the authors use it in a different way from that of job crafting. In Table 2 we describe the differences between job crafting and the perspectives on job change offered here. Personal Initiative Personal initiative also resembles job crafting (Frese, Kring, Soose, & Zempel, 1996; Frese, Fay, Hillburger, Leng, & Tag, 1997). Frese and col- leagues (1996) define personal initiative as a behavioral syndrome in which individuals take self-starting approaches to work and go beyond formal job requirements. Individuals taking per- sonal initiative engage in behaviors that (1) are consistent with the organization's mission, (2) have a long-term focus, (3) are goal directed and action oriented, (4) are persistent in the face of barriers, and (5) are self-starting and proac- tive. These researchers (Frese et al., 1996, 1997) have developed this concept through a com- parison of East and West Germans' personal initiative. Like job crafters, those with personal initiative redefine jobs to include extrarole work goals (cf. Staw & Boettger, 1990). However, Frese and col- leagues emphasize problem-solving dimen- sions of personal initiative. Similarly, Morrison and Phelps (1999) describe \"taking charge\" be- haviors, which also improve how work is exe- cuted in the organization.

Organizational Citizenship Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) provides yet a different lens for understanding employees' behaviors. Organ (1988) first defined OCB as individual discretionary behavior that is not explicitly recognized by the organization- al reward system but, in the aggregate, in- creases the effectiveness of the organization (Organ, 1988: 4). Later, Organ (1997) redefined OCB along the lines of a similar construct, called \"contextual performance\" (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993), which consists of behaviors that support the broader organizational, social, and psychological environment of the organiza- tion. OCB includes generating new ideas for doing work, helping others with their work, be- ing cheerful and neat, accepting orders without resentment, cooperating with others at work, and doing high-quality work (Bateman & Organ, 1983). OCB is mostly targeted at helping others in the organization or the organization itself, whereas job crafting is focused on changing the task and relational landscape to alter work meaning and identity. While some crafting be- haviors might be described as OCB (e.g., doing extra work to move projects along, forming rela- tionships with clients), the intent behind such behavior is not fully to promote the good of oth- ers and the organization. Rather, job crafting can be motivated by a",

As such, it is not simply about doing more or doing better, which is the focus of OCB. Task Revision Task revision is the practice of employees' taking action to correct a faulty procedure, inac- curate job description, or dysfunctional role ex- pectation (Staw & Boettger, 1990: 537). Staw and Boettger (1990) have shown that people engage in more task revision when they are in charge of and accountable for the function they perform and when alternatives for doing the task are salient. Again, the focus in task revision is on problem solving or correction of work proce- dures. These researchers argue that when organ- izational roles are misspecified (from the em- ployee's perspective), then task revision can be a valuable outcome. We contend that making changes in work tasks is beneficial not only when problems exist but also when task func- tions are entirely appropriate and functional, since they can enhance the meaning of the work. Staw and Boettger also argue that task revision should have a low base rate in organizations, since it \"involves resistance to social norms and expectations\" (1990: 538). We expect job crafting to appear often, in many different kinds of work. The organizational studies literature reveals several examples of job crafting that illustrate and animate the model of job crafting we have described. In the next section we describe six examples of job crafting in action. The examples come from narrative or qualitative descriptions of work. We have culled from these sources evi- dence that job crafting is a part of the work being studied by organizational scholars, and we illustrate the antecedents and consequences of this important individual activity. EXAMPLES OF JOB CRAFTERS The examples of job crafting we offer range from the subtle to the more obvious actions of employees. We start with a study of hospital cleaners who craft the work very differently. Our other examples come from published research in organizational studies. Hospital Cleaners Integrating Themselves into Care Delivery System One study of a hospital cleaning staff shows that cleaners experienced and constructed the meaning of their work very differently (Dutton, Debebe, & Wrzesniewski, 2000). It became evi- dent, through a series of personal interviews with twenty-eight members of a hospital clean- ing staff about the nature of their work, that while the cleaners had",

The contrasts among the cleaners were striking, ranging from how they described the skill level of the work to the kinds of tasks they would do.

One group created a task and relational boundary in the job that included only a mini- mum of necessary tasks and interaction with as few others as possible. Members of this group disliked cleaning in general, judged the skill level of the work to be low, and were less willing to step outside formal job boundaries to engage with others and alter job tasks. In contrast, the second group of cleaners altered the task and relational boundaries of the job to include addi- tional work tasks, as well as frequent interac- tions with patients, visitors, and others in their unit. Members of this group liked the job, en- joyed cleaning, felt the work was highly skilled, and engaged in many tasks that helped patients and visitors and made others' jobs in the unit (e.g., nurses, clerks) go more smoothly. Table 1 describes the three dominant forms of job crafting that emerged from our examples. The cleaners engaged in the first form of job crafting by doing (or not) tasks that were outside the formal job. For example, cleaners in the pro- active group added tasks or timed their work to be maximally efficient with regard to the work- flow on their unit. By changing their work tasks, or by timing their regular tasks with care, clean- ers altered the meaning of their work. Cleaners in the more proactive group saw the work and themselves as critical in healing patients, alter- ing the meaning of the work and their own work identity. In contrast, cleaners in the less active group restricted the meaning of the work to be- ing simply about cleaning and did not see them- selves as anything other than room cleaners. Such differences in how employees define their jobs echo Morrison's (1994) account that employ- ees vary in what activities they consider part of the job. The cleaners also changed the relational boundary of the job by altering their interactions with others at",

While the passive cleaners did not seek additional interaction, the proac- tive group engaged patients and visitors in ways that fundamentally altered the job. Many of the relational interactions that cleaners en- gaged in were intended to brighten someone's day (e.g., talking to patients, showing visitors around). The proactive group of cleaners also interacted more often with the nurses on their units, resulting in a work unit that functioned more smoothly. Cleaners manifested a third form of job craft- ing by changing the cognitive task boundary of the job so that they saw their job as an inte- grated whole, rather than as a set of discrete tasks (e.g., cleaning rooms). For example, proac- tive cleaners reported an increased number and complexity of interactions with others at work. They saw the larger picture of the unit workf low and adjusted their timing and tasks in response to this more interdependent view. These clean- ers' own work descriptions revealed an aware- ness of the broader unit context in which they worked, which was reflected in their relation- ships with others and in the kinds of tasks they chose to do. Hairdressers Cutting Hair and Crafting a More Enjoyable Job Cohen and Sutton's (1998) ethnographic study of hairdressers also brings to life the promi- nence and pattern of job crafting. Their findings reveal hairdressers as able job crafters who change both the task and relational boundaries of the job by making personal disclosures about themselves, asking clients personal questions, punishing clients who refuse to disclose, and sometimes \"firing\" clients to create more desir- able and affectively pleasant interactions. Hair- dressers in this study changed the job tasks to include not only physically cutting hair but also getting to know clients-a practice that changed the relational boundary of the job by bringing hairdresser and client closer together. Just as a subset of cleaners altered the phys- ical and relational boundaries of their job, hair- dressers created new jobs for themselves within the context of their prescribed role as hairdress- ers, in which norms against personal disclosure are sometimes enforced by management (Cohen & Sutton, 1998). Again, job features may have encouraged job crafting: hairdressers' tasks are low in interdependence, and there are very low levels of employee behavior monitoring. Accord- ing to our model, these should have promoted job crafting as well. Engineers Creating Jobs to Enable the Success of Projects and",

The first kind of work was preserving, which included taking on extra work in order to get a task done, connecting people on the project to the people and resources needed to do their work, and rescuing the project by calling atten- tion to problems that needed to be addressed. Mutual empowering entailed behaviors that en- abled others' achievements and contributions to the project (Fletcher, 1998: 170). These behaviors often involved teaching others a new skill in an empathetic manner or connecting others on the project to protect them from their own lack of relational skill. The third form of relational prac- tice, achieving, involved reconnecting cowork- ers to avoid breaks in relationships, reflecting on the emotional nature of work situations and calibrating responses appropriately, and rela- tional asking (i.e., asking for help in ways re- spectful of others and their tasks). Finally, the engineers engaged in creating team, or provid- ing the conditions that allowed a team to do its work. They enabled collaboration by smoothing relationships and including everyone in the team effort. Fletcher's taxonomy of relational practices il- lustrates how design engineers altered the task and relational boundaries of their jobs. By changing job tasks and how they were executed, engineers created new task boundaries to move projects toward completion. In addition, they changed relational boundaries by working to- ward a positive atmosphere for teamwork and by connecting people on the project to get work done, both of which involved changing the qual- ity and amount of interaction with others. Fi- nally, the engineers engaged in the third form of job crafting by shifting their focus from discrete project tasks to the whole project. By constructing themselves as preservers, em- powerment givers, achievers, and team creators, engineers changed the meaning of the job, from engineering to enabling an organization's work to go more smoothly. Creating such work condi- tions allowed the engineers to exert control and build relationships with others. At the same",

This construction of the work and its significance to the organization enhanced its meaning to the self, creating dif- ferent identities. Nurses Creating a Pocket of Care Around Patients A fourth example of job crafting in the work- place comes from two complementary studies of the nursing profession (Benner et al., 1996; Jacques, 1993). Benner and her colleagues inter- viewed and observed nurses from a variety of units, whereas Jacques observed nurses from a single unit to quantify acts of caring in their work. Both studies convey the skilled caring work that occurs in the practice of nursing and the role of this work in the organization's mis- sion. The nurses acted as job crafters by actively managing the task boundary of the job to deliver the best possible patient care. By paying atten- tion to the patient's world and conveying seem- ingly unimportant information to others on the care team, nurses re-created their job to be about patient advocacy, rather than the sole de- livery of high-quality technical care. Nurses changed the relational boundary of the job by expanding their relationship set to include patients' family members, on whom the nurses relied for information and input. Benner and her colleagues (1996; see also Jacques, 1993) describe examples of nurses engaging patients' families and involving them in the illness pro- cess to achieve the best patient outcome. Skilled nurses recognized that nonquantifiable and nonmedical observations were critical inputs in treating patients (Benner et al., 1996). Learning to seek out, notice, and convey this information to other care providers represented job crafting that helped the patients and the organization. Information Technicians Supporting the Computer Workplace Star and Strauss (1999) provide a fifth example of job crafting in their analysis of technicians' work in computer-supported cooperative work environments. They document the often unrec- ognized work of technicians, including articula- tion work, in which employees work to \"get things back 'on track' in the face of the unex- pected, and modify action to accommodate un- anticipated contingencies\" (Star & Strauss, 1999: 3). Articulation work allows for smooth work- place operation, but it is rarely acknowledged. Much like the relational work of Fletcher's engi- neers (1998), articulation work enables others to get their work done.

Often, practices that appear as \"non- work\" serve the organization in important ways. Those in information technology work craft their jobs by altering the task and relational bound- aries of the work to achieve the organization's mission. For example, what might seem like chatting between organization members may be \"work\" to smooth communication between man- agers of different work units. Restaurant Kitchen Employees Creating Cuisine The final example of job crafting comes from Fine's ethnographic study of work in restaurant kitchens (1996a,b). Fine describes how profes- sional cooks engaged in structuring multiple tasks under time pressure in ways that reflected job crafting. By taking shortcuts and using tricks of the trade to compose a meal, professional cooks and kitchen staff altered the task bound- ary of their jobs by changing (1) the number of tasks and (2) the way they saw their tasks, from being a set of discrete food preparation steps to an integrated whole of dish creation that re- flected the artistic character of their work. Fine uses the term aesthetics to describe activity in which the \"sensory component of production ... captures the cognitive and affective compo- nents of aesthetic judgments and ... the inten- tional quality of human action\" (1996b: 178). Like the other job crafters we have described, the cooks changed their identity through their exe- cution of the work-in this case, from food pre- parers to culinary artists. In creating dishes, cooks used their creative impulses to craft meals in ways that connected them to the work. Rather than simply prepare food that served customers' needs, the cooks tried to make the food as \"nice\" as possible, thus changing the task boundary of the work. Instead of thinking about the preparation of meal ele- ments as separate tasks, the cooks engaged in the third form of job crafting by seeing their work as being about the gestalt of the entire meal. The cooks used their own artistic stan- dards in trying to create a product worthy of pride. As such, the cooks Fine studied experi- enced \"flow\" as they executed their work tasks (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975), paying attention to their own artistic vision rather than manage- ment policy",

Cooks often tried new food combinations, creating novel dishes in order to meet job demands (i.e., preparing cus- tomers' meals) in ways that allowed them to experience the work as meaningful and cre- ative, rather than scripted and uninspired. In all of the examples, employees actively crafted the job, sometimes against manage- ment's wishes. Rather than have managers in- tervene to enable or encourage these employees to act as job crafters, the employees took initia- tive on their own. Each example suggests that employees actively shape both the design and the social environment of their jobs by changing job tasks and job-related interactions and rela- tionships. DISCUSSION Our model and examples of job crafting offer three contributions to how organizational schol- ars think about and study job design, work meanings, and work identity. These contribu- tions address how individuals, jobs, and indi- viduals-in-jobs are conceptualized and studied. More generally, job crafting offers an alternative lens for understanding basic dynamics of work in organizations such that organizational ele- ments that once seemed fixed (i.e., jobs) are made more complicated and dynamic. Job Design With our model of job crafting, we contribute to theories of job design by offering a new per- spective on how jobs are constituted. We have specified the motivations, job, and individual features that create situations making job craft- ing possible. The process we propose opens up different pathways for understanding how peo- ple change their jobs and effectively shows that employees can be competent designers of their work. This suggests that employees are more agentic than typically depicted in theories of job design. Rather than paint employees as passive recipients of job tasks or of social information about job tasks, our job crafting model indicates that employees alter their jobs and use the feed- back from these alterations to further motivate job crafting.

The job crafting perspective flips this relation- ship around with the assertion that responses to a job actually begin the dynamic process in which employees alter task and relational boundaries in ways that change work meaning and identity. Thus, job crafting offers an alter- native to job design perspectives, in which the employee is effectively placed in the position traditionally held by managers and is viewed as a competent and active architect of the job. Also, job crafting offers an alternative to the other perspectives reviewed here on how jobs change. In these perspectives managers are called upon to design more complex work, to permit greater autonomy, and to give feedback about the changes that employees make to their jobs. In contrast to such managerial-focused views of work, we argue that employees take on the role of job crafters even in work that might be con- sidered low in autonomy (cleaning), authority (nursing), or complexity (cutting hair). Meaning of Work Our job crafting model contributes to the liter- ature on the meaning of work by indicating how employees shape work meanings. Work mean- ings shape work motivation and performance (Roberson, 1990: 107) on the job; thus, a model of the processes by which employees imbue their work with meaning contributes to what we know about the meaning of work. Historically, the meaning of work has been argued to be the product of one of three forces. First, the work environment (design of job and reward struc- ture) is thought to affect how individuals derive meaning from the work. A second influence is the individual; the psychological attributes and characteristics of the individual employee are thought to affect the kinds of meanings as- signed to the work (Roberson, 1990). Indeed, de- bates have arisen over the relative strength of these two determinants of work meaning. Third, advocates of the social information processing perspective (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978) have argued that the social environment (e.g., man- agers, coworkers) at work helps employees in- terpret which job and work setting attributes are most important. All three perspectives are help- ful for understanding the sources of work mean- ing, but they do not address the dynamic inter- play between employee and job that we present here. The evolving relationship between the em- ployee and the job captured in the job crafting model suggests a dynamic view of individuals-",

We have argued that individuals play an active role in creating the meaning of their work, through the small changes they make in task, relational, and cognitive boundaries of the work, and we have shown the different contexts that enable or disable these kinds of job impro- visations. More broadly, however, we hope to suggest a more holistic view of how individuals compose their lives and the meaning of their lives by changing their jobs and themselves within them. Through proactively crafting their jobs, people may create different trajectories through an organization and enact their work lives dif- ferently over time. Although job crafting behav- iors are locally situated at any given point in time, they are connected to employees' enduring needs at work and their more general framing of the domain of work. Individuals and Work Identity As agentic architects of their own jobs, job crafters enable transformations of work identity. Although some elements of job crafting might seem like extrarole behaviors, they are rooted much more deeply in identity-altering processes that redefine both the employee and the job. A model of job crafting helps identity theorists to untangle the process through which identity- based motivations (i.e., desire for a positive im- age) change how people enact and craft their jobs. Thus, the shaping of a work identity through job crafting becomes an employee's be- havioral accomplishment, undertaken over time with others encountered on the job. Our model of job crafting paints employees as proactive and creative identity builders who take opportunities they see in their work setting to engage others in ways that change work iden- tity and work meaning.

We have named some of the ways that job crafters use their job tasks and relationships to change identity and meaning in the work; there are likely many more.

By changing with whom they re- late, job crafters highlight the relational nature of work in organizations. This point reminds us, as organizational scholars, that work is more than job content and tasks; it also concerns re- lationships with other people (Baron & Pfeffer, 1994; Gersick, Bartunek, & Dutton, 2000). These relationships and the interactions composing them help to create and sustain not only differ- ent notions of what the work is but also who the person is who is doing the work. Practical Implications of Job Crafting Job crafting is neither inherently good nor bad for organizations. The degree to which job craft- ing behaviors contribute to organizational per- formance depends on the kinds of changes em- ployees make and on job crafting's proximal effects on employee motivation and perfor- mance. We have suggested that job crafting is one route by which individuals alter the mean- ing of work and forge new identities. If these meanings and identity constructions motivated behaviors that aligned individual work patterns with organizational objectives, then job crafting could be a net positive for the organization. However, if job crafting altered connections to others or task boundaries in ways that were at odds with organizational objectives, job crafting could harm rather than enhance organizational effectiveness. Crafting's effects on organiza- tions are also dependent on the systems in which individuals work; what others do to craft their own job interacts with any one individual's crafting behaviors to influence organizational outcomes. There are important managerial implications of job crafting. These implications are both em- powering and disempowering for managers wishing to affect job crafting. Job crafting is a process that can be affected only indirectly by managerial action. If we think about managers as architects of the contexts in which individual action is enabled, or not (Ghoshal & Bartlett, 1994), managers can affect the context in which individuals do job crafting, although they may not be able to affect when and to what extent job crafting occurs. Managers have direct control over the incentives and material rewards that are associated with job outcomes. These re- wards and incentives may encourage or dis- courage individuals to alter the relational and task boundaries of the job. At the same time, managers may affect how work is organized in ways that enhance or undermine employees' de- sire and capacity for job crafting. Thus, manag-",

Managers also affect job crafting by indirect means. For example, organizations can include or exclude people from strategic conversations about what they are trying to accomplish and why (Westley, 1990). \"The development and cas- cading of a strategy are critical management tasks\" (Mohrman, 1993: 135), and they shape the extent and type of job crafting likely to take place. When employees know and buy into the strategic goals of an organization, they can use this knowledge to motivate and legitimate their own job crafting behaviors. We saw this kind of effect for hospital cleaners, who used the stra- tegic goals of the hospital to motivate the fram- ing of cleaning as care for customers. This type of work framing helped to legitimate a different form of relating to patients and visitors and en- couraged the addition of caring tasks to the work. Beyond thinking about how to affect patterns of job crafting, the crafting perspective opens up new ways of thinking about the competence in- volved in how employees conduct their work. Crafting takes effort. It often involves a series of creative acts in which employees push, shrink, or transform task and relational boundaries. So- cialization programs and employee training would benefit from a recognition that this kind of activity occurs. In organizations in which crafting behavior is a means for \"growing a job\" or developing an employee, active acknowledg- ment and encouragement of job crafting are likely to yield tangible and intangible benefits.

A closer look at the lives of individual employ- ees might also help explain job crafting. In our model we primarily consider the work context as shaping job crafting. Such a view violates a more holistic account of human behavior, in which individuals in their work and nonwork contexts would be considered. In future research scholars could consider the ways that motiva- tions at work are related to demands and oppor- tunities in employees' nonwork lives and how the meaning of work created through job craft- ing is related (or not) to the meanings and mo- tivations that employees take from their non- work activities. The antecedents to job crafting motivation should be further delineated in future research. Features of individuals, jobs, and organization- al contexts create motivation for crafting behav- iors. Broadly speaking, any factor in individuals' personal or organizational lives that makes job crafting a vessel for need fulfillment is a poten- tial antecedent for the motivation to job craft. We offer a few, realizing that the full set is much richer. First, individuals whose lives outside the job are not well positioned to fulfill needs for control, connection with others, or positive iden- tity might be more motivated to meet these needs in the domain of work. Second, features of the job or occupation are likely to affect the motivation for job crafting. For individuals who work in stigmatized occupations, the pressures to assert a positive identity are greater (Ashforth & Kreiner, 1999). Thus, job crafting that is in- tended to restore or create positive identity in one's work is more likely among those in stig- matized or \"dirty work\" jobs, and it could be an effective local solution to an occupational prob- lem. Third, those who work at levels of the or- ganization in which freedom and creativity to craft are constrained might find that they are more motivated to work against these con- straints by using job crafting as a vehicle for control and self-expression. In future research scholars should expand upon the set of individual factors affecting job crafting. For example, employees who view work as simply the source of a paycheck might reduce the amount and complexity of the tasks to be performed in the job (Henson, 1996), whereas those who view work as an enjoyable end in",

Individual economic needs also may shape crafting to signal ability and effort on behalf of the organization that are likely to be rewarded (Brief & Aldag, 1989; Brief, Konovsky, Goodwin, & Link, 1995). Finally, those who view work as a calling are more engaged with their work, spend more time working, and view the job as more central to their lives (Wrzesniewski et al., 1997). As a result, these employees may actively craft their jobs because of a higher in- vestment in the work itself. In future research scholars could also focus on the process of job crafting and how it unfolds over time. Our model of job crafting provides snapshots of features that are conducive to the occurrence of this behavior. However, we ignore how the process unfolds over time. Future re- search would benefit from a more nuanced and processual account of how job crafting is initi- ated; how it is sustained and transformed in the work process; and how it resembles (or not) learning, improvising, and creative processes over time. Job crafting is indeed dynamic. This raises methodological challenges for how to best study the practices, forms, and outcomes of job craft- ing in organizations. We believe it is no coinci- dence that the examples of crafting we discov- ered in the organizational literature arose from detailed qualitative studies of work. It is possi- ble that studying narratives of work may be a better way to study job crafting, for crafting takes many forms and directions, involving how people see their work and themselves in their This content downloaded from 195.34.79.223 on Thu, 12 Jun 2014 21:06:32 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions === Page 20 === 2001 Wrzesniewski and Dutton 197 work. Such matters are not often easily reduced to simple survey items. Thus, methodological care ought to be taken when one attempts to discover the nature of job crafting in employees' work lives. Finally, we have construed job crafting as an individual-level activity. Valuable future re- search could be focused on exploring collective and negotiated forms of job crafting that are team based rather than individually based. Where task boundaries are drawn around teams or collections of individuals, there may be more opportunities to revise, alter, and craft rela- tional and task boundaries as part of",

In future research scholars could address the joint collab- orative \"working out\" of job boundaries that is done in the context of work organized around groups rather than individuals. CONCLUSIONS Work in the twenty-first century increasingly will be changed by the necessity for more em- ployees to actively craft their own work lives, as opposed to having them created by others (Bridges, 1994). Thus, we have much to learn from those who craft their own jobs. We believe that those who have worked in occupations of- fering little autonomy, complexity, and authority have always had to \"take it or make it\" in terms of the jobs they create for themselves (Juravich, 1985). We can glean important lessons from the examples offered here about how job crafters draw and redraw the task and relational bound- aries of a job to make it a more positive and meaningful experienrce. At the same time, we realize the limits of this agentic view of job crafting. Structural con- straints do constrain job crafting possibilities. Economic constraints give individuals differen- tial resources to derive job meaning (Brief & Nord, 1990). Differential occupational status, prestige, standards, and requirements bestow or deny individuals with varying resources the op- portunity to evaluate, interpret, and act within job categories (Pavalko, 1988). Finally, organiza- tional values, beliefs, and norms, as well as research on the division of labor within the or- ganization, can affect employees' ability to con- struct a job differently. However, despite these constraints, we believe individuals do make use of limited job resources in creative and master- ful ways. We have much to learn from them about how to create a meaningful job from ma- terials that, many would argue, are limited in both value and amount. In addition to revising passive perspectives of employees, the job crafting perspective follows the common call to \"write the worker back in\" as an active participant in shaping both the job and its meaning. By stressing the prominence of crafting practices and their effects for work meaning and identity, our perspective is consis- tent with theories of work meanings that are based on the individual (Alderfer, 1972; Staw, Bell, & Clausen, 1986; Wrzesniewski et al., 1997). However, we add an important element by high- lighting how the relationship among the em- ployee, others, and the job itself ultimately shapes the meaning of the",

Our perspective reframes the debate over dis- positional versus situational influences on work meaning. Instead of asking what determines job attitudes and work meaning, we are trying to change the question to ask how individuals shape their own work meanings through job crafting. Our view offers a reason for Spector and Jex's (1991) failure to find a strong link be- tween job incumbents' descriptions of their job characteristics and those offered by the U.S. Dic- tionary of Occupational Titles. If employees crafted their jobs by changing task characteris- tics, we would expect weak relationships be- tween the prescribed job and the job the em- ployee created. Why is it necessary to call attention to job crafting? Certainly, our perspective may be in- terpreted as little more than a timely correction to more passive models of how employees be- have at work. However, we feel that in the cur- rent work environment, the nature of work is changing along with contemporary organiza- tions (Rousseau, 1997). Employees are increas- ingly being treated as \"free agents\" (Bridges, 1994), left to shape their own work experiences and career trajectories. Thus, in addition to its contribution to our understanding of common notions of work, the job crafting perspective should play a critical role in understanding changes in the nature of work. As Rousseau (1997) points out, a shift has occurred in organi- zations such that the process of organizing is the This content downloaded from 195.34.79.223 on Thu, 12 Jun 2014 21:06:32 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions === Page 21 === 198 Academy of Management Review April new focus to which we should direct our re- search efforts. This new model of organizations leaves open opportunities for improvisation and control over work by the individual employee. As organizations change their forms and func- tions more quickly, employees need to funda- mentally realign how they understand the firm (Lau & Woodman, 1995). Thus, employees' ability to craft their own jobs (and, thus, their under- standing of their role in the organization) may be a strategic advantage in larger-scale organ- izational change. Also, we are entering an age of renewed en- trepreneuralism, in which millions of employees have left their organization to go it alone. In such an environment, understanding job craft- ing",

By uncovering hid- den crafting skills that employees have and of- ten use, we can explore the possibilities that emerge when we understand employees as able to change the form of their jobs to create work meaning and viable work identities. In addition, employees may be leaving organizations to form their own entrepreneurial ventures out of growing dissatisfaction with the opportunities they detect for crafting their own jobs within the organization. It is possible that employees have been frustrated in their attempts to make their jobs their own. By frustrating the job crafting efforts of employees, organizations may carry some of the responsibility for recent increases in entrepreneuralism in the United States. REFERENCES Adler, A. 1930.

The highest possibilities of human nature have practically always been underrated.... what we call ‘normal’ in psychology is really a psychopathology of the average, so undramatic and so widely spread that we don’t even notice it ordinarily.” === Slide 2 === What is the cost of replacing an employee? === Slide 3 === The rise of new incomes === Slide 4 === Stay Interview === Slide 5 === Interview questions (pick and choose, but don’t wing it) Can you list the top four reasons why you stay in your current role? Are there any individuals who really make a positive difference and therefore contribute to your commitment to stay? Do you feel your work makes an impact in the organization? Help me understand the factors that make you feel you are having an impact? Do you currently feel that you are doing some of the best work of your life? Can you list for me the factors that would contribute to that? If you were given the opportunity to redesign your current role, what would you change to make it your dream job? If you managed yourself, what would you do differently, that I as your current manager, don’t do? === Slide 6 === Follow up Write up their ‘stay factors’ Share it with the employee Decide on action items you can take forward If needed, consult with direct manager and HR Follow up 3 months later to check in with player to see if they acknowledge the changes",

They detect the stances you operate from “Distinctioning” = becoming aware = change in stance Distinctions enable a clear grasping of new choices available === Slide 6 === A Powerful Distinction: Should vs. Must Majority of people act from what they “must do” as employees, managers, parents. Acting from a place of “should” elevates effectiveness by incorporating a sense of meaning Creating significance in the things you do (“should”) creates energy that in turn moves you forward. Doing things you must to that feels like checking off a checklist. For example – spending time perfecting a hobby vs. doing chores. Which is more fun? Which is done with a sense of flow? What is your Inner stance in these situations? Now think which one of these is dominant when you work? === Slide 7 === Straight Line Individuals “Are you understanding it or are you living it?” When not pleased with the current results change stance until it achieves goals Create and utilize internal tools – distinctions. Once those tools are incorporated, there is nothing but pure, powerful, intelligent action! Choose to drop disempowering identity (self-concept) by shifting inner stance by using distinctions === Slide 8 === Straight Line Leaders Create responsibility, don’t just accept it Motivate by seeing the distinctions in themselves and others Lead people, organizations from A to B in straight lines See decisions to make and not problems === Slide 9 === Characteristics of Straight Line Thinkers Decisive action is the solution to fear and builds confidence A straight-line individual uses language that creates an invented future (point B) and then they declare the necessary action Creating commitments: a commitment is a created stance in which you know what you will do (or not do) regardless of what happens in order to achieve a goal Straight-line individuals care so much that they don’t care: meaning that they care so much about their goal that they don’t care about anything else (how they come across, peoples’ judgments) === Slide 10 === Circular Thinking Individuals Their",

Constant state of waiting reduces energy, demotivates versus an active situation of advancement that empowers and contributes to growth. === Slide 14 === Significant Distinctions What I Live vs. What I Know Implementation and not knowledge alone is what creates advancement and success Doing empowers, creates energy and action and thus closes the gap between us and out end goal Without implementation knowledge becomes stagnant Example: “The book worm” or “eternal academic” versus “the doer” === Slide 15 === Significant Distinctions Worry vs. Concern A state of worry occupies the individuals ability to disconnect from the situation and solve it Being concerns contains both empathy and connection but enables creativity that leads to solutions Example: Over identification that sometimes derives from extreme concers makes the individual experience the hardship of the other, distancing from rational thinking and problem solving. Try think of a “Polish mother” versus a good mentor at work === Slide 16 === Significant Distinctions Being Bold vs. Being Arrogant Being bold is showing courage, taking action if when you don’t want to Being arrogant covers up insecurity and arrogant people find difficulty in winning support of others in the long run People who are arrogant are bullies, will get what they want but will scae off others Being arrogant can means acting superior to others by using",

I don’t know how to… 2. I don’t know what to.. 3. I don’t know who to… These stances are untrue whilst what is true is that the individual hasn’t chosen to act yet For example: Claiming to not know how to network and get to know new people. It’s a choice to be made and implemented. Knowing does not lead to successes, choosing to do does. === Slide 18 === Significant Distinctions Owner vs. Victim Being the owner of our life means creating the circumstances we want/need to achieve our goals Being an owner mean always being aware of the choice I have Whilst victims are fixated with the past, owners focus on the here and now and creating the future The owner gives him/herself the permission to live the life s/he is living. The victim awaits external permission Ownership is asking: “How do I empower myself in this situation?” An owner’s life is based on what he is here to do. A victim’s life is based on what he seeks to avoid. === Slide 19 === Significant Distinctions Problem vs. Decision to make Many think that they “deal” with their problem by talking and thinking about it Choosing action towards solution is making a decision The inner stance shifts when the power to act in the situation has been taken up by the individual === Slide 20 === Significant Distinctions Can’t vs. Won’t Cant; refers to what is not possible for you to do Won’t refers to something that is within your capability to do but is your choice not to, not to invest the effort to. The test: if someone offers you $5M to do something will you? If the answer is “hell yes”, your inner stance is “won’t” Most people don’t separate between “can’t”s and “won’t”s – this consumes energy and disempowers Shifting between the stances means leaving your comfort zone and by asking: 1) What comfort choices do I need to give up? 2) What growth choices do I need to take on?

He can opt to play the blame game and be toxic towards employees or see where his responsibility can help ease the situation === Slide 22 === Significant Distinctions Content with Insight vs. Only Results Count “To bankrupt a fool, give him information” Nicholas Nassim Taleb Utilizing and implementing information and insight narrows the gap to success, desired results The distinction is created by asking: “How do we actually put what we know to use to expand our work?” When an insight occurs you have taken in information. The leap is created by taking appropriate action with the information === Slide 23 === Significant Distinctions Productivity vs. Busyness Excessive busyness is a form of show business Productive actions create free time which is the opposite of busyness Busyness is a result of not taking the correct productive actions Straight-line leadership is all about leading yourself and others out of the woods of busyness PRODUCTIVITY = doing what’s in front of you that will lead to the attainment of your desired outcome BUSYNESS = activity driven out of desperation because you didn’t handle what was in front of you and don’t want to appear as if you have quit trying",

COMPOSING THE REFLECTED BEST-SELF PORTRAIT: BUILDING PATHWAYS FOR BECOMING EXTRAORDINARY IN WORK ORGANIZATIONS LAURA MORGAN ROBERTS Harvard Business School JANE E. DUTTON GRETCHEN M. SPREITZER EMILY D. HEAPHY ROBERT E. QUINN The University of Michigan Business School We present a theory of how individuals compose their reflected best-self portrait, which we define as a changing self-knowledge structure about who one is at one's best. We posit that people compose their reflected best-self portrait through social experiences that draw on intrapsychic and interpersonal resources. By weaving to gether microlevel theories of personal change and macrolevel theories of human resource development, our theory reveals an important means by Which work orga nizations affect people's capacity to realize their potential. Being extraordinary does not necessarily mean obtaining a position of honor or glory or even of becoming successful in other people's eyes. It means being true to self. It means pursuing our full potential (Quinn & Quinn, 2002: 35). Being extraordinary. All o? us can recall our own extraordinary moments?those moments when we felt that our best-self was brought to light, affirmed by others, and put into practice in the world. These memories are seared into our minds as moments or situations in which we felt alive, true to our deepest selves, and pursuing our full potential",

Sometimes this portrait is composed gradually and without much conscious attention or self awareness. Other times, work organizations play an active role in providing us feedback, furnishing goals, and enabling relationships with others in ways that make this portrait ex plicit and consciously changing over time. Whether implicit or explicit, stable or changing, this portrait serves as both an anchor and a beacon, a personal touchstone of who we are and a guide for who we can become. We call this portrait the \"reflected best-self\" (hereafter re ferred to as the RBS). We choose the word \"reflected\" to emphasize that this self-portrait is based on our percep tions of how others view us. Family members, friends and acquaintances, and organizations provide us with feedback about who we are, and this information is integrated into our self concept (Cooley, 1902; Tice & Wallace, 2003). We choose the word \"best\" to refer to the strengths, contributions, and enduring talents that each person brings to a situation. Taken together, this means that through interpretations of experi ences and interactions in the social world, each person composes a self-portrait of his or her own strengths and contributions. We posit that the process of composing the RBS portrait creates a pathway to becoming extraordinary, in that it involves envisioning the self at one's best, and then acting on this vision to translate possibili ties for the extraordinary into reality. Our purpose here is to define the RBS, de scribe how and when it changes, and articulate the ways in which it influences individual func We thank Art Brief, two anonymous reviewers, the faculty and staff at the University of Michigan Business School, Brianna Barker, Robin Ely, Monica Higgins, Joshua Margolis, Leslie Perlow, Jeffrey Polzer, Ryan Quinn, Lloyd Sandelands, Neil Sendlebach, Kathleen Sutcliffe, David Thomas, Klaus Weber, and Mich?le Williams for helpful comments on ear lier drafts.

In so doing, we build on the prin ciples of positive psychology (Seligman & Csik szentmihalyi, 2000) and positive organizational scholarship (Cameron & Caza, 2004; Cameron, Dutton, & Quinn, 2003; Luthans, 2002), which aim to develop theoretical understandings of human strengths, virtues, and health, as opposed to the predominant focus on weakness and pathology in work organizations. Our theory of how people compose the RBS portrait builds on current research regarding how individuals change their conception of self through socially embedded experiences and re sources (Higgins & Kram, 2001; Tice & Wallace, 2003). More specifically, our theory of composing the RBS portrait sits at the crossroads of several important research streams in organizational behavior. First, we build from theories of career and personal change that purport that changes in self-knowledge structures are critical ele ments in explaining how and why individuals change what they do and how they feel (Ibarra, 1999; Markus & Nurius, 1986). Second, we build on research that portrays individuals as active participants in constructing their organizational experience through how they take initiative (Frese & Fay, 2001; Morrison & Phelps, 1999), seek information about themselves (Ashford, 1986), and create and draw from relationships with others (Wrzesniewski, Dutton, & Debebe, 2003). Third, we draw on research showing that the relational context in which individuals are em bedded has a major effect on how people define and feel about themselves (Bradbury & Lichten stein, 2000; Ely, 1994; Gabarro, 1987; Gersick, Bar tunek, & Dutton, 2000; Granovetter, 1985; Kahn, 1998) which, in the case of our theory, is captured in the power of mirrored reflections. THE REFLECTED BEST-SELF We define the RBS as an individual's cogni tive representation of the qualities and charac teristics the individual displays when at his or her best. Our definition of the RBS shares some features of self-schemas. Markus defines self schemas as \"cognitive generalizations about the self in particular domains, derived from past experience, that guide the processing of self related information contained in the individu al's social experiences\" (1977: 64). Like self schemas, the RBS is based on past experiences and guides the processing of personally rele vant information generated in the social world. For example, someone who exhibits resilience and determination in response to being denied a job promotion, to receiving",

However, as the previous example in dicates, the RBS is not based on a single domain but is a more general and encompassing con ception of the self that cuts across multiple do mains. Thus, we use the term RBS portrait in stead of schema to describe this broader cognitive representation of the self. As a positive portrayal of desirable, self relevant characteristics, the RBS portrait also shares some features of the \"ideal self\" (the cog nitive representation of one's hopes, wishes, or aspirations; Higgins, 1987) and the \"hoped-for possible self\" (the manifestation of enduring personal goals, aspirations, and motivation; Markus & Nurius, 1986). However, the RBS por trait is distinct from the ideal self and the hoped-for possible self in that it is based on qualities and characteristics that the person currently has, as opposed to those the individual wishes or hopes to possess. As an example, take this excerpt of a person's description of his RBS, which he wrote as part of an MBA course exer cise to integrate feedback he had received from others about who he is at his best: At my best-self: I share, I strip away all that life is not. I live large. I breathe deeply and inhale every whisper of life. At my best-self, I challenge myself mentally, physically, emotionally. At my best self, I am neither at work [n]or at play, I am living in the moment. I am a lover of life. I am a seeker of truth and beauty. I am responsible for my own actions, my own beliefs, and my own connections with other people and all living creatures. At my best-self, I am small, invisible and insignificant. People don't see me, they don't feel me, however, they see truth and beauty in themselves and in the world around them that they would not have noticed had I not been there, and they feel phys ically, emotionally and mentally better because of me (Chad Brown, 2001, personal correspon dence).

This description also illustrates that the RBS is more than a cat alog of competencies. While one's strengths (i.e., competencies, talents, values, personality at tributes) lie at the core of one's RBS, the RBS portrait also incorporates a characterization of the state of being at one's best. In this state of being, an individual actively employs strengths to create value, actualize one's potential, and fulfill one's sense of purpose, which generates a constructive experience (emotional, cognitive, or behavioral) for oneself and for others. Often times, the state of being at one's best is charac terized by being true to oneself (Palmer, 2000; Quinn & Quinn, 2002) or authentic (Harter, 2002) and high performing (Spreitzer, Quinn, & Fletcher, 1995). In addition, in our theory, we look within one individual to learn how that person can enter his or her best state, rather than following the more traditional, normative approach of looking across people to see who is the best among a group or class. Thus, this conception of the \"best\" stands in contrast to evaluative measures across people, such as performance evaluations that rank order or group people within a given distribution. To better understand the power of the RBS in shaping human development and functioning, we focus in the next section on illustrating the process by which individuals compose their RBS portraits. Following this discussion of compos ing the RBS portrait, we describe how the results of this process directly impact identity, well being, and behavior in work organizations. COMPOSING THE RBS PORTRAIT How do people identify the personal qualities and characteristics that constitute their RBS por trait? Through experiences with others, people gather information that enables them to build a composite portrait of who they are at their best. This portrait is shaped by the individual's per ceptions, rather than an absolute \"truth\" of what the RBS is. Research supports that people's per ceptions of how they are viewed?not how they are actually viewed by others?have the stron gest impact on people's self-concepts (Tice & Wallace, 2003). The self-concept is based on our observations of ourselves, our inferences about who we are (gleaned from others' behavior to ward us), our wishes and desires, and our eval uations of ourselves (Stets & Burke, 2003). Thus, the RBS portrait is",

While the RBS portrait, like self-schemas (Swann, 1985), begins to form in childhood, the process of composing the RBS portrait can con tinue throughout life, as social experiences en able people to see more clearly who they are at their best. However, composing this portrait of the RBS can be challenging, especially in cur rent work organizations. All too often, the infor mation people get about themselves is reflected through rare and imperfect mirrors. Formal performance evaluations are the most common way individuals get external feedback about their competencies in organizations. Per formance evaluations are institutionalized prac tices in which people, typically superiors but increasingly subordinates and peers as well, grade how employees have performed along a number of prespecified dimensions. Perfor mance evaluations are used to justify rewards and to define developmental opportunities for enhancing current performance and preparing for future career possibilities. While experts rec ommend sandwiching negative feedback within positive feedback (Beer, 1997), invariably, the fo cus of a performance evaluation is on identify ing weaknesses and combating performance deficits (Buckingham & Clifton, 2001). Because performance evaluations tend to narrow atten tion toward the negative aspects of human per formance, they tend to provide people with mere glimpses of their RBS. Individuals might proactively seek additional feedback about their sources of competence from significant others (Ashford, 1986). Signifi cant others are those people whose views and opinions matter to an individual because of power asymmetries, resource dependence, or emotional attachment. Research suggests that more powerful individuals' opinions carry weight simply because they command more at tention (Fiske & Depret, 1996). Levinson (1985) suggests that the actions and opinions of guid ing figures?people who embody what an indi vidual is trying to move toward in life?are par ticularly significant when people are undergoing transitions. For example, Ibarra (2003) describes how Ben Forrester's boss (a guiding figure) pro vided reassurance and feedback as Ben was This content downloaded from 62.122.79.90 on Wed, 18 Jun 2014 10:47:46 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions === Page 5 === 2005 Roberts, Dutton, Spreitzer, Heaphy, and Quinn 715 trying to shift from an academic to a leader ship role in a nonprofit consulting firm.

Despite the value that reflected appraisals have for enabling people to see and feel new possibilities for themselves, norms of humility often constrain people's willingness to ask oth ers to identify their own sources of strength (Quinn & Quinn, 2002). Alternatively, people monitor their own performance and make infer ences about their competence by observing sit uational cues and others' responses to their be havior (Ashford, 1986; Ibarra, 1999). As a result, people rely on a patchwork quilt of imperfect and incomplete reflections from others, often composed on the fly. And given that cognitive biases and heuristics (Bazerman, 1986; Tversky & Kahneman, 1986), along with the desire to im press others (Giacalone & Rosenfeld, 1989; Goff man, 1959; Schlenker, 2003), often lead people to overestimate or underestimate their perfor mance, the sole reliance on monitoring during everyday interactions may not produce a sub stantive and vivid portrait of the RBS. Despite the challenges involved, work organi zations can enable individuals to compose more substantive and vivid portraits of their RBS. We posit that altering the kinds of social experi ences one has can induce a substantive shift in how one envisions oneself. As individuals learn more about their personal strengths, limitations, and ability to add value, they are likely to change the content of the RBS portrait by adding and subtracting qualities so that the RBS is more closely aligned with their revelations from these experiences. Tice and Wallace provide the following example of a content change in one's RBS: One day Denise's rabbi asks her to paint a mural for the synagogue wall. Denise is surprised when her rabbi tells her, \"We all think you are a terrific painter. Your father and sisters brag about you all the time.\" When Denise realizes that her fam ily and friends think she is a good painter, she changes her view of herself and starts to think of herself as artistically talented (2003: 91). In addition, as individuals participate in so cial experiences that reveal their personal strengths, the image of their RBS may become more vivid, because it is associated with spe cific action tendencies that supplement their values, beliefs, and wishes. For example, a manager already has a vague sense that he enjoys administration and is particularly skilled at organizing major projects and events, but the experience of",

Quite the opposite, he realizes it is an inherently so cial process of cocreation. As a result, he in cludes an additional statement in his RBS por trait: \"In planning and executing, I incorporate others' strengths, talents, and gifts so that they will be constantly reminded that their contribu tions are valued.\" After his experience, he has a more vivid picture of what he does and how he does it when he is at his best. His RBS portrait is more deeply rooted in his personal experience. This process of changing the content or clarity of the RBS portrait, which we term revision, is an important phase in the lifelong task of compos ing the RBS portrait. In the next section of the article, we explain how social experiences facilitate revisions of the RBS portrait. We posit that revisions to the RBS portrait are catalyzed by trigger events, which we refer to as jolts. RBS revisions are most likely to occur when individuals who experience jolts also possess critical socially embedded re sources (i.e., positive affect, positive relation ships, and personal agency) that enable them to respond to the jolts in constructive rather than destructive ways. There is likely to be variation in the degree of change in one's RBS that results from any given jolt, based on (1) the magnitude of the jolt one experiences (which can range from a major life event to the \"straw that breaks the camel's back\") and (2) the level of socially embedded resources one possesses. 1 This example is disguised, although the facts are real.

Only occasionally do life events intrude on or interrupt daily routines, prompting individuals to pause and make sense of life events in a way that triggers a revision to their RBS portrait. Sensemaking involves plac ing life experiences into a framework in order to help people comprehend, understand, and ex plain experiences in a way that gives meaning, purpose, and direction to action (Weick, 1995). Revising the RBS portrait is a sensemaking pro cess, in that it involves deriving new self relevant information from social experiences, imposing meaning on the information, and us ing the information to inform one's understand ing of the RBS. Surprisingly, there is a dearth of research on what triggers changes in self-knowledge struc tures like the RBS, but the dominant intuition is that sch?mas change as a function of some dis continuity in the environment (Swann, 1985; Walsh, 1995). We suggest that revisions to the RBS occur when individuals undergo an \"aha\" experience or jolt?a discrepant or surprising event that causes people to pause and reflect on their experience (Louis, 1980). Losing a job is a classic example of a jolt (cf. Lee & Mitchell, 2001), but jolts can also include joyful events like a birth of child or a promotion. A jolt doesn't have to come in the form of a major event. Rather, jolts can vary in magnitude. A person can be jolted by a new piece of infor mation that serves as a tipping point (Ibarra, 2003) for revising his or her RBS portrait. For example, when a law clerk gets yet another piece of positive feedback on his writing talent, this time from a federal judge, he can no longer ignore his passion and skill for writing legal briefs. Similarly, after the senior management team accepts her fourth marketing campaign, an associate begins to discover a pattern of suc cess, which reveals her unique talent for cre ative design. Jolts trigger changes in self-knowledge struc tures because they disrupt routines in ways that release emotion (Mandler, 1984) and help people change cognitive gears (Louis & Sutton, 1991). Jolts disrupt automatic modes of information processing and reliance on well-grooved ways of thinking about the self that accompany an automatic processing mode (Bargh, 1982). As Poole, Gioia, and Gray suggest, experiences",

Jolts punctuate experience by unfreezing peo ple so they can begin to move away from the old and focus energy toward the future (Ibarra, 2003; Weick, 1995). Because they intrude or interrupt, jolts provide what Ibarra calls an \"alert admis sion\" (2003: 138)?a moment when pivotal events catalyze change. These alert admissions or \"de fining moments\" (Badaracco, 1997) trigger a need for explanation (Louis, 1980), and they test, shape, and reveal something about how people think about themselves and their capabilities. Jolts can test whether the new information re vealed from the jolts fits with the current RBS portrait. They can also shape revision of the RBS as the individual integrates new pieces of infor mation into the RBS portrait. Jolts can reveal aspects of the RBS that have been hidden and can provide a sharp, clear view of aspects of the RBS that were previously obscure. In short, jolts get people's attention and jar people toward de liberate judgments about their RBS because they are an occasion for sensemaking. We propose that in work organizations jolts that provide occasions for revising RBS portraits come in at least four forms. While the word \"jolt\" may connote an experience that is negative in tone, we use the term more broadly. As our pre vious examples indicated, positive experiences can also jog people out of routines and prompt them to think about themselves in new ways. As such, we talk about jolts along two key dimen sions: (1) jolts based on challenge or based on affirmation and (2) jolts generated by formal or informal mechanisms (see Figure 1). By juxta posing these two dimensions, we create a typol ogy of jolts, which we describe in more detail in the subsequent sections. Challenging Jolts Challenges require special effort and dedica tion to overcome because they take individuals out of their routines and provide an opportunity for action (Csikszentmihalyi, 1993). Challenges stretch individuals in new directions.

Challenges?what Bennis and Thomas (2002) call \"crucibles\"?move individuals to transcend the usual ways of doing things by putting them in difficult but not impossible situations (Tomaka, Blascovich, Kibler, & Ernst, 1997). Unlike threatening jolts that imply the real potential for failure or harm, challeng ing jolts imply the possibility of gains and, thus, energize individuals (Tomaka, Blascov ich, Kelsey, & Leitten, 1993). Formal challenges. Often, in work organiza tions, formal, organizationally sanctioned occa sions provide employees with challenges that could prompt them to change how they see themselves at their best. For example, when or ganizations elevate performance targets, plan job rotations and \"stretch assignments,\" insti tute managerial training or executive develop ment programs, or provide difficult new goals based on individual performance evaluations, they create settings that are designed to chal lenge employees in significant ways. Individu als may be prompted by these situations to per form novel tasks, which may extend their current knowledge base of their strengths and abilities to include additional self-knowledge regarding how they perform in these new do mains. Simultaneously, they may receive feed back from others in their environment regarding their competence in this new domain. This ex panded knowledge base of strengths and capac ities can serve as input for revising the content of the RBS portrait. In addition, engaging in an experience that draws on one's strengths and competencies may make the RBS portrait more vivid. For example, Kyle Vest, a successful family practitioner, was part of a novel medical prac tice that encouraged physician sabbaticals (at half pay) to explore old talents and to develop new ones. For Kyle, the sabbatical provided a chance to try out his teaching talents in a novel course for medical students on the power of nar ratives of healing. Kyle was astounded by the feedback that he received from his students and other physicians regarding his effective means of challenging students, his thoughtful portray als of patients' pain, and",

The teaching experience changed how Kyle envisioned his future possi bilities. As a result, he negotiated a change in his employment contract so that half of his time could be devoted to teaching. Thus, organizations that provide formal op portunities for accomplishing challenging goals and assignments may also facilitate the process of composing the RBS portrait by enabling em ployees to revise the content or increase the clarity of their image of who they are at their best. In fact, if work organizations were effective growers of employees' potential, employees' work lives would be sprinkled with appropriate and well-orchestrated formal challenges (Mc Cauley, Ruderman, Ohlott, & Morrow, 1994). But too often organizations fail to design develop mental opportunities so that a revision of the RBS can occur, or they offer generic opportuni ties that fall short of meeting the needs of spe cific individuals (McCall, Lombardo, & Morrison, 1988). Informal challenges. Jolts also occur in the form of informal challenges that arise at work, often appearing when employees least expect them. Such occasions afford developmental op portunities that could give rise to an altered view of one's RBS. For example, when a col league is a \"no show\" for some important event, another employee is called on to take the col league's place and perform a new task (e.g., presenting task force recommendations to the board of directors). In a more extreme example, Ferit ?ahenk, CEO of Turkish conglomerate Dogu? Holdings, was thrust into the senior lead ership position of the organization when his fa ther was diagnosed with cancer (Khurana, Car rioga, & Johnson, 2001). In both examples, an employee had to accept a difficult challenge and learned that he or she \"has what it takes\" to perform in a new task domain. Such impromptu challenges confront individuals with occasions in which their current capacities are stretched. These spontaneous occasions usually call for new behavioral patterns; consequently, individ uals may learn about limitations as well as new possibilities for themselves that prompt a revi sion of the content and/or",

Cooperrider and Srivastva (1999), citing Kolb (1984), describe appreciation as a form of knowing that stands in sharp contrast to critical comprehension: Appreciation of immediate experience is an act of attention, valuing and affirmation, whereas crit ical comprehension of symbols is based on objec tivity (which involves a priori controls of atten tion, as in double-blind controlled experiments), dispassionate analysis, and skepticism (Kolb, 1984: 104-105, in Cooperrider & Srivastva, 1999: 90). Research shows that when people are fully aware of how others view them, their reflected appraisals shape their self-concept (Jussim, Sof fin, Brown, Ley, & Kohlhepp, 1992; Tice & Wal lace, 2003). Appreciation stimulates reflection and action because it disrupts expectations for the future, induces positive emotion, and also may engage physiological changes that are generative and constructive, helping one move toward a more positive image of oneself and resulting in positive action (Cooperrider & Sri vastva, 1999). Formal appreciation. Formal appreciation jolts are occasions in which organizations have planned and institutionalized opportunities to endow individuals with expressions of positive affirmation. Award ceremonies are the most common manifestation of formal appreciation jolts. For example, when people are endowed with an award for early career contributions, they gain information about the value they add to their field, which encourages them, in turn, to expand their vision of the RBS. The reward in duces positive emotion, which facilitates a per son's ability to see the self differently (Fredrick son, 1998). In addition, these occasions provide individuals with access to previously hard-to find social resources. For example, the early ca reer contributions award recipient may feel af firmed in her choice of career path, energized to pursue her goals with confidence, and better able to pursue those goals because of the new positive visibility the award has given her. As a result, the RBS can be affirmed and clarified through formal appreciation jolts. Formal appreciation jolts are rare in practice and often occur as organizational members are leaving situations, eliminating the opportunity This content downloaded from 62.122.79.90 on Wed, 18 Jun 2014 10:47:46 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions === Page 9 === 2005 Roberts, Dutton, Spreitzer, Heaphy, and Quinn 719 for the individuals and their organization to benefit from enduring changes brought about by the formal appreciative acts.

Often, retirees' reac tions to such events are, \"I had no idea people felt this way about me.\" Letters of recommenda tion also describe one's strengths, but in order to maintain objectivity, such feedback often is not shared with the recipient of the recommenda tion. These formal appreciation jolts could prompt a revision of how people see themselves at their best by providing specific information about how they contribute to the social system. Take the example of Inari Kaju,2 who started a soft ware development firm five years ago. Every quarter he has each member of his eight-person top management team e-mail descriptions of the three strengths each person has exhibited dur ing the quarterly period. The e-mails are shared with the whole team. Kaju has found that this practice has kept people focused and excited about what the firm is accomplishing, while at the same time helping people to become famil iar with their own unique strengths (as seen and affirmed by others). This practice also helps peo ple know how strengths are distributed among the top management group. Kaju suggests that this knowledge has helped the firm adapt com petitively, because the team knows who is the \"go to person\" for different challenges (because of demonstrated success in the past), facilitating speed in decision making in the present and building confidence about decision making in the future. Informal appreciation. Organizational set tings also afford opportunities for more im promptu, unplanned, and spontaneous jolts that are appreciative and informal. While rare, these occasions can jar and disrupt how employees see themselves. For example, an African Amer ican medical student described the spontaneous encouragement that he received from hospital staff, patients, and other members of his com munity (Black, 2003). When African American hospital staff and other community members no ticed his stethoscope or lab coat in the hospital elevator, they expressed the pride they derived from his presence. Further, when he treated an African American patient, the patient expressed sincere gratitude for his respectful and consci entious care, remarking that it felt good to know that the medical student was looking out for his best interests. These conversations surprised the medical student, who previously saw him self only as an intelligent but",

This feedback prompted him to revise his RBS portrait; he broadened his best-self image to include being a healer, whose successful ed ucational pursuits and considerate patient care positively impact the lives of many people, par ticularly other African Americans who value in teractions with African American physicians. In another example, one of the authors was treated to one such act of informal appreciation. As she described it: Marty Johns, the head of Change Management Teaching Team, assembled his team designed to create the next generation of classes for Execu tive Education. The team had never been face to face in a room, although the reputations of the people assembled preceded them. There was ex citement in the air, with everyone anticipating the stretch and high standards involved in this new assignment. Marty began the meeting in a highly unusual way. Rather than having every one introduce him or herself, he began with an appreciative introduction of each person, offering his take on the unique talents, perspectives, and qualities of each chosen team member as a hu man being. The introductions weren't long, but each adjective and example Marty offered seemed compelling and heart felt. The descrip tions named what Marty loved and appreciated in each person. Each person being introduced was visibly embarrassed when they were de scribed, but inspired and thankful to be on the team as they learned of the positive qualities of their team members. The soil for growth of the team had been tilled with respect and positive regard. In this simple act Marty had taken an ordinary routine used when first meeting strang ers and turned it into an extraordinary opportu nity for informal appreciation (Dutton, 2003b). In this case, members of the team had to re vise their sense of self, drawing more fully on the publicly acknowledged strengths Marty noted he saw in them. For Meg, one of the team members, this meant realizing that her enthusi asm actually motivated others to get work done. For Rob, the introduction meant he needed to act in accord with Marty's portrayal of him as a creative writer and courageous thinker.

Research supports the relationship between informal appreciation and self-perceptions de scribed in the previous two examples. When significant others perceive an individual as pos sessing the characteristics of his or her ideal self, the individual then changes his or her self views to be more consistent with the others' ap praisals (Drigotas, Rusbult, Wieselquist, & Whit ton, 1999; Malloy, Albright, Kenny, Agatstein, & Winquist, 1997; Tice & Wallace, 2003). In addi tion, after people receive explicit positive feed back, their self-appraisals become more favor able (Kernis & Johnson, 1990). Thus, appreciative and challenging jolts can be important triggers in revising the RBS por trait. We have provided several examples of how appreciative and challenging jolts can en hance one's positive self-construal by increas ing the clarity and/or enriching the content of one's RBS portrait. It is important to acknowl edge that not every jolt results in a revision to the RBS, owing to the nature of the jolt, the timing of the jolt, and, most important, how one makes sense of the jolt. Like self-schemas, our RBS portrait is quite stable over time. Since self-schemas are resis tant to change, some jolts may not be strong enough to radically change one's image of the RBS. Completing a novel yet relatively simple task may not require a radical shift in behavior that could lead to self-discovery. Likewise, a single compliment regarding a minor accom plishment at work might not have a lasting im pact on one's sense of self. External factors, es pecially the timing of the jolt, might also interfere with RBS revision. For example, a per son who is not psychologically ready for a change can ignore the jolt, dismiss it as irrele vant, or deny its validity (Ibarra, 2003). Also, a person may not have the space or a \"window of opportunity\" for a revision to the RBS. As Ibarra suggests: Reinvention ... requires a stepping back to ob tain a new way of seeing what is. The full emo tional and cognitive complexity of the change process can only be digested with moments of detachment and time for reflective observation. In the same way, time away from the everyday grind creates the \"break frame\" that allows peo ple to transition",

If a person is overloaded (cognitively, emotion ally, or physically), it will be difficult for him or her to transcend the current situation to create the space for a RBS revision. Furthermore, a person's life stage may also influence the extent to which he or she responds to a jolt. Research on adult development sug gests that at certain points in life, like midlife (Levinson, 1985), individuals are highly recep tive to major changes, whereas at other periods of life, individuals meet even small changes with resistance. For these reasons, many exter nal triggers fail to propel a person to change self-knowledge structures, including the RBS. Finally, individuals must make sense of jolts in a constructive manner in order to trigger RBS revision. Often, challenging and appreciative jolts are met with a sense of fear, threat, and cynicism, rather than with a sense of possibility for envisioning oneself in a more positive man ner. Individuals who focus on the negative, po tentially punishing effects of jolts are less likely to revise their RBS portraits than individuals who focus on the positive, potentially rewarding effects of such experiences. For example, indi viduals might interpret challenging jolts as sig nificant threats to their organizational status and focus on potential failure in new job assign ments, rather than the possibility of success. Individuals might also question the accuracy of affirmative feedback they receive from others, as well as their ability to live up to others' pos itive expectations. In both scenarios individuals will likely resist revising their RBS portrait, even after experiencing challenging or appreciative jolts, because their sensemaking leads them to focus on personal limitations rather than per sonal strengths and contributions. Our goal in this paper is to present a theoret ical framework that captures how work experi ences enhance one's sense of self and result in revisions to the clarity and content of the RBS portrait. Thus, we focus our theoretical attention away from the inhibitors and toward the key resources that can positively shape the way in dividuals appraise or make sense of a jolt. We posit that certain socially embedded resources enable individuals to counteract the effects of inhibitory factors (such as threat, fear, or cyni cism) so that they can respond positively to jolts.

In the next section we describe how three specific re sources play an important role in the process of revising RBS portrait by favorably influencing responses to challenging and appreciative jolts. Resources That Enable Revisions of the RBS Portrait A central premise of our article is that socially embedded resources enable revisions of the RBS portrait, particularly during times surrounding a jolt. Revisions of the RBS portrait do not occur easily or often, because they involve changes in how we think about ourselves. Before such revi sions occur, individuals need a sense that re sources are available to counteract the negative responses that may result from jolts. Psycholog ical and physiological3 resources help individ uals to withstand the uncertainty and fear of failure that arise from challenging jolts. They also spark individuals' desire to live up to the social expectations that are raised through ap preciative jolts. We suggest that a trio of psychological and physiological resources?(1) positive affect, (2) a sense of relational connection, and (3) personal agency?enable revision of the RBS portrait. Positive affect enhances openness and personal capability, relational resources provide social support and inspiration, and agentic resources provide a sense of efficacy and guidance to fa cilitate changes in the RBS. To better understand why these three re sources matter, we discuss their causal logic next. For explanatory purposes, we artificially treat each resource as if it were a separate causal force. In reality, many developmental work experiences tap into all three resources, activating them to work in concert to focus on and revise our sense of ourselves at our best. Positive affective resources. The first durable resource that can enable revision of the RBS is positive affect. By affect, we mean the emotional and subjective feelings of individuals. Positive affect is composed of positive emotions, such as joy, peace, hope, or gratitude, which are durable resources that individuals can draw on during times of change, owing to their effect on individ uals' thought-action repertoires (Fredrickson, 1998). Unlike negative emotions, which promote quick, decisive action by narrowing the array of thoughts and actions that come to mind, the broaden-and-build theory states that positive emotions broaden the thought-action repertoire, creating",

Joy, for instance, sparks the urge to play. Interest creates the urge to explore. Contentment evokes the urge to savor and inte grate. Thus, positive affect enables the revision of the RBS by creating more openness to the idea of personal change. In addition, Fredrickson (2000) proposes that a critical outcome of the broadened thought action repertoire is increased personal capabil ity and knowledge. The playfulness that comes from joy, for instance, builds personal skills and capability. The exploration that comes from in terest creates knowledge and intellectual com plexity. And the savoring that comes from con tentment produces self-insight and alters world views (Fredrickson, 2000). As such, the broaden and-build theory suggests that positive emo tions are resources that build enduring capabil ity and knowledge, which also enable revisions of the RBS. We suggest that experiences at work that engage positive emotions are more likely to contribute to the revision of the RBS in terms of reflecting domains of additional competence and talent, along with broadening the self conception of strengths and positive contribu tions. The resources brought to bear by positive emotions are particularly important during jolt experiences, because they work to undo the de structive effects of negative emotions, such as enabling the body to return to baseline levels of physiological activation after experiencing a challenge (Fredrickson, 2000). Laboratory exper iments have demonstrated that evoking positive emotions during times of distress is the most efficient way to quell or \"undo\" the lingering aftereffects of negative emotions (Fredrickson & Levenson, 1998; Fredrickson, Mancuso, Brani gan, & Tugade, 2000). Following experiences of 3 While physiological research is new to organizational behavior, researchers working at the interface of the social and medical sciences use physiological measures to under stand the mechanisms explaining the powerful effects of positive affect and interpersonal relationships (see Heaphy & Dutton, 2004).

In contrast, without the positive affect, any distress accompanying a jolt is likely to inter fere with a willingness to open oneself up to new skills and capabilities. The discomfort of a jolt may mask the potential for revising the RBS, since the individual can become defensive and seek a fast solution to overcome the discomfort (McCauley et al., 1994). In summary, positive affect provides an im portant resource for enabling individuals to re vise their RBS portrait because it opens them to the possibility of revising the RBS and builds personal capability and knowledge. Relational resources. The second durable re source that can enable a revision of the RBS portrait is positive interpersonal relationships. We assume that all human beings have a need to develop and maintain enduring personal con nections with others, and these connections of affirmative belonging are sources of support (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). The positive impact of supportive relation ships is well documented in the literature on social support (e.g., Uchino, Cacioppo, & Keicolt Glacer, 1996) and high-quality connections (e.g., Dutton, 2003b; Dutton & Heaphy, 2003). Support ive relationships provide security and safety for individuals to process and affirm a clearer sense of their own possibility. They may do this in part by inducing physiological changes that enable individuals to bounce back from past negative experiences, such as releases of oxy tocin and endogenous opiad peptides, lowered blood pressure and allostatic load (Adler, 2002; Seeman, Singer, Rowe, Horwitz, & McEwan, 1997), and a strengthened immune system (Co hen, 2001; Ornish, 1998). Being in relationships with others can also buffer people from future setbacks and Stressors in their lives (Cohen & Wills, 1985), allowing them to devote more men tal energy to their own sense of possibility rather than potential failure, thus enabling re vision of the RBS. Research on holding environments at work (Kahn, 2001) and on healing connections more generally (Miller & Stiver, 1997) affirms the role that positive connections play in supporting a person's revision of the RBS.

Safe relationships \"hold\" people while they recover from Stressors and, thus, en able them to move forward to a clearer sense of possibility (Kahn, 2001). Friends, mentors, and other close connections act as significant others who help to reduce the emotional angst of being confronted with an alternative view of oneself. When these connections with significant others are secure attachments, individuals feel com fortable in branching out in new directions and embracing new identities. These significant oth ers can offer inclusion and provide a secure base (Ibarra, 2003), helping people evolve to ward their best-self. Without them, individuals may be more reticent to change. These sorts of relational resources are particularly relevant during jolt experiences (McCauley et al., 1994) and during transition points or life stages when an individual may be more open to others' feed back and help (Levinson, 1985). In organizations, developmental relationships constitute a specific type of relationship that provides important resources for making sense of and responding to jolts. A person may have one such relationship or a \"constellation\" of de velopmental relationships (Higgins & Kram, 2001). When a prot?g? experiences a jolt, a de velopmental relationship can provide the con text to make sense of what the jolt means from someone with a different, often more senior po sition in the organization, and it can provide ideas as well as support for how to revise the RBS. In addition, a mentor can provide social and emotional support to help the prot?g? inte grate his or her identities through counseling, acceptance, confirmation, and friendship (Kram, 1985). In essence, developmental relationships can assist the prot?g? in interpreting a jolt, mak ing it intelligible and actionable.

They include a sense of self efficacy in revising the RBS portrait, as well as constructive guidance about how to revise it. Examples of these enabling forces are dis cussed below. Agentic resources encompass the sense of self-efficacy?the belief that one can success fully execute the behavior required for produc ing desired outcomes (Bandura, 1989). When in dividuals feel self-efficacious, they see their behavior and identity as not completely shaped by external forces; instead, they see themselves as being able to make things happen by their own action. With self-efficacy, individuals feel potent and capable of revising the RBS portrait in several ways. First, the fundamental belief that a person can make things happen in signif icant ways alleviates the tendency to avoid risks or to avoid trying new things. Second, self efficacy determines how much effort people will exert and how long they will persevere in the face of obstacles such as jolts. Self-efficacy helps people recover quickly from failures and setbacks before losing faith in their capabilities. Thus, when employees are confronted by jolts at work, but agentic resources are present, their sense of heightened capacity to respond encour ages revision of the RBS portrait. Agentic resources also influence how people envision themselves and their future and, thus, guide changes to the RBS through the notion of hope. Hopeful people have an understanding of the will?that is, efficacy beliefs that a hoped for goal can be achieved?and the way?that is, a plan to achieve the hoped-for goal (Snyder et al., 1991). Research shows that without hope hu mans are paralyzed and unable to change in any meaningful way. But with hope people act, change, and achieve (Stotland, 1969). Thus, a sense of hope also enables a sense of the \"way,\" thereby providing constructive guidance about changing the content or clarity of one's RBS por trait. When individuals possess a large degree of agency, they set higher personal goals, pro viding a positive guide for revising the RBS por trait. On the contrary, low levels of agency may induce the visualization of failure scenarios, where individuals dwell on what can go wrong (Bandura, 1989), which leads them to focus on their deficits rather than their strengths.

The multiplicative effects of jolts and re sources. This trio of resources works in concert to enable the revision of the RBS by reducing the destructive elements and increasing the con structive elements of jolts. For example, an ap preciative jolt is usually associated with posi tive emotions and a sense of belongingness (e.g., one feels valued by others, and this engen ders positive emotions). Similarly, a challenging jolt is usually associated with an increased sense of personal agency (e.g., one learns that one is able to effect change in the social system). In work organizations, it is rare, but not im possible, to experience such a combination of jolts and to have sufficient amounts of the trio of resources that are powerful enough to yield sig nificant revisions of the RBS portrait. A prime example of this combination is an intervention that was developed several years ago with the explicit aim of helping executives to compose their RBS portrait (Quinn, Dutton, & Spreitzer, 2003; Quinn & Quinn, 2002). In the intervention a person requests written feedback from signifi cant others describing the person at his or her very best. The person asks between ten and thirty friends, family members, and coworkers, who the person feels know him or her well and will provide honest opinions, to provide best self feedback. The descriptions usually include detailed stories and examples of the person when he or she is making a distinct and extraor dinary contribution?of when and how he or she creates the most value for the system.

Our research suggests that collecting this composite of RBS sketches from a variety of peo ple from different realms of one's life is a pow erful, integrative, and creative act. It is also a generative act, in the sense of creating a social product that constructs oneself in the world in a particular way, and this construction, in turn, creates a trajectory for future action that propels one in a direction that affirms rather than denies one's sense of unique possibility in the world. In sum, this formal appreciative jolt is imbued with positive affect, relational connectedness, and personal agency so that the recipient of the feedback is able to revise his or her RBS portrait and advance along a trajectory toward becom ing extraordinary. One who is extraordinary can be considered a positive deviant, because he or she exemplifies qualities and behavior that exceed standard or normal expectations. Extraordinary people, like extraordinary events, are remarkable; their ac tions are difficult to ignore because they have a major, positive impact on individuals, systems, organizations, and the environment. Social change agents, like Martin Luther King, Jr., Jesus, and Gandhi, were extraordinary leaders (Quinn, 2000). Although they often lack notoriety and orga nizational rewards, many current organizational members are extraordinary; they, too, approach their role with the intention of improving effi ciency and quality of work life for those they support by leveraging their strengths. This tra jectory toward becoming extraordinary is charted by expanding knowledge about one's RBS and putting this knowledge into practice with increasing regularity. In the final section of this article, we make an explicit link between composing the RBS portrait and becoming ex traordinary. THE RBS AND BECOMING EXTRAORDINARY Our theory of the RBS proposes that there are three pathways by which the RBS portrait helps employees to become extraordinary: (1) expand ing the constellation of possible selves, (2) facil itating social architecting, and (3) enhancing personal expressiveness. The core premise of each pathway is that individuals' self-construc tions guide their future actions through intra psychic and social processes (Fiske & Taylor, 1984; Gioia & Poole, 1984). Taken together, these three pathways encompass an increased preva lence of extraordinary thoughts about one's identity, extraordinary actions that shape the social system, and extraordinary feelings of well-being. In turn, these thoughts, actions, and feelings (re)generate resources that enable these",

RBS and Possible Selves When employees revise their portrait of who they are at their best, they necessarily paint new possibilities for their future. These possibilities are captured in their constellation of possible selves. As defined by Markus and Nurius (1986), possible selves refer to the selves that a person could become, would like to become, or is afraid of becoming. For example, consider the case of a professor who revised her RBS portrait to in clude her newfound capability as an executive education teacher. Previously, she had only con sidered herself as one who was effective at teaching master's and undergraduate students. This change in her RBS fundamentally trans formed her sense of what she could become. Her constellation of possible selves expanded to ac commodate new future work domains, and she started to see new possibilities for incorporating these talents in her vision of herself. She took new risks and tackled new tasks. She sought out new opportunities for executive teaching, even flying to another university to do so. She also wrote a book that drew on her research but that could be used exclusively with executives. At the same time, she noticed that revising her RBS portrait also affected her vision of what she was unlikely to become: a teacher whom executives experienced as stifling and disengaging.

They shape how people ap proach future tasks by sparking anticipation and simulations of task performance (Cross & Markus, 1994). Possible selves help people focus on specific thoughts and feelings that affect their ability to accomplish relevant tasks (Ingle hart, Markus, & Brown, 1988). The more vivid and elaborated the possible self is in a particular domain, the more powerful its link to a person's performance will be in that domain (Cross & Markus, 1994).

Her work is particularly relevant, since it suggests that as individuals embark on career transitions, their possible selves capture images of the type of professional they aspire to become. These im ages of hoped-for possible selves shape profes sionals' capacity to successfully construct and project images of competence and credibility to key constituents (i.e., colleagues and clients). In the professions Ibarra studied?investment bankers and management consultants?craft ing a viable professional image was critical for eventual career success. Because the RBS portrait (who one is at one's best) and possible selves (who one can become) are both elements of the self-concept, they are experientially and cognitively intertwined. However, we think it is important to distinguish the two schemata types in order to test how, separately and in unison, they help individuals make behavioral adjustments that propel them along the pathway of becoming extraordinary.

Thus, we call individuals' pro active selection of settings, people, and tasks that draw on their strengths \"social architect ing.\" The idea that individuals engage in social architecting is well established in psychology and sociology (e.g., McCall & Simmons, 1978; Schlenker, 1985) and is implied by some models that portray individuals as proactive agents in their own self-development (Ashford & Tsui, 1991) and in the design of their jobs (Wrzes niewski & Dutton, 2001). These views portray individuals as active crafters of their social en vironments in ways that support and sustain desired views of themselves. For example, Dweck, Higgins, and Grant-Pillow (2003) found that visions of the ideal self result in an overall promotion focus whereby people create goals that relate to their aspirations,",

Schlenker, in his model of identity formation, argues that \"people strive to create environments in both their own minds and the real world that support, validate, and select desirable identity images\" (1985: 89). The RBS portrait is clearly a desirable identity im age that is grounded in feedback and reflections from others. Composing a clearer and more sub stantive RBS portrait allows people to be better social architects, in that they control their own destinies and constructively shape their futures by shaping the contexts of which they are a part. A critical part of social architecting involves forming connections with individuals who en able the RBS to thrive. Research on how individ uals craft jobs that enhance self-meaning illus trates this point. For example, in a study of how hospital cleaners enact their job differently, Wrzesniewski and Dutton (2001) found that cleaners who enjoyed the work and saw it as a type of \"calling\" (Wrzesniewski, McCauley, Ro zin, & Schwartz, 1997) perceived themselves at their best as healers and hope providers, play ing a critical role in patients' recovery and care. Cleaners in this group actively architected the context by building relationships not only with patients but also with patients' families and friends?relationships that served to affirm and enact their RBS as healer. In this case, the clean ers were architecting the relationships in con text to derive affirmative meaning and to create jobs that were more satisfying and fulfilling. This example illustrates Wrzesniewski and Dut ton's claim that people are often \"agentic archi tects of their own jobs\" (2001: 194). We add to their formulation the idea that if individuals ar chitect the context in ways that play to their RBS portrait, they create a pathway toward becom ing extraordinary. Similarly, social architecting may involve re arranging one's time and tasks so that one is involved in tasks that draw on one's strengths. For example, in the story of the professor who came to see that she could enact her RBS more often as an engaging teacher of executives, this RBS revision fueled her choices to spend more time teaching executives and less time teaching master's and undergraduate students. This transformation was clearcut and visible to her and to others. More subtle were the gradual investments that she made in conversations and connections with other executives that helped her to communicate more effectively with exec utives",

She gradually created a different landscape of learning that deepened her knowledge and ex perience base. In turn, she strengthened her competence in teaching to an executive educa tion audience. Thus, she traveled in big and little steps toward being extraordinary by archi tecting the context that simultaneously lever aged and strengthened her RBS. RBS and Personal Expressiveness When people revise the RBS portrait, they do more than cognitively change what they see as possible. Our theory suggests that changes in the RBS portrait also alter how people feel about who they are becoming, which creates a sense of vibrancy and energy that fuels travel toward being extraordinary. To capture the feelings that accompany the process of composing the RBS portrait, we draw from psychological work on optimal functioning, in particular the idea of personal expressive ness (Waterman, 1993). Personal expressiveness refers to a state of well-being in which people are living in accord with the \"daimon\" or true self (Ryan & Deci, 2001). This state of well-being, known as personal expressiveness, is associ ated with a set of feelings that indicate someone is \"intensely alive and authentic\" (Ryan & Deci, 2001: 146).

A focus on the importance of this form of eudaimonic well-being has also been emphasized by psychologists studying psychological well-being and health across the life span (Ryff & Singer, 1998, 2000). Their theory of human flourishing also emphasizes the im portance of people's psychological sense that they are realizing their potential, and they link this state to healthy functioning of physiological systems. As people receive more reflections of who they are at their best, their RBS portrait becomes more substantive and more vivid.",

As individuals compose a more elaborated and vivid RBS portrait, they are bet ter able to identify goals that are aligned with their true self (Sheldon & Elliot, 1999). When these self-concordant goals are acted on, they contribute to a heightened sense of personal expressiveness. Further, as the RBS portrait becomes more fo cused and elaborated, individuals acquire a greater sense of relatedness to others, which fuels great personal expressiveness. In compos ing the RBS portrait, individuals develop in creased clarity regarding how they add value to their social context, which also strengthens their sense of purpose and identification (Stets & Burke, 2003; Stryker, 1980) with other people who share that social context. A variety of studies document the association of greater relatedness and attachment to a heightened sense of well being (see Dutton & Heaphy, 2003, for a sum mary; see also Higgins & Thomas, 2001). Finally, as individuals compose their RBS por trait, they are likely to become better able to cope with stress. Revising the RBS portrait en hances one's sense of self, and self-enhance ment has been linked empirically to healthier physiological and neuroendocrine functioning (Taylor, Kemeny, Reed, Bower, & Gruenewald, 2000). Self-enhancement is correlated with lower cardiovascular responses to stress, more rapid cardiovascular recovery, and lower baseline cortisol levels, which help individuals amelio rate damaging biological responses to the stressful conditions they may face (Taylor, Ler ner, Sherman, Sage, & McDowell, 2003). In sum, the RBS portrait is associated with a range of outcomes that individually and collec tively equip individuals to move down the path toward becoming extraordinary. The link be tween the RBS and possible selves creates a cognitive image of a desired future state that helps guide an individual's path. The RBS also furnishes individuals with a portrait of what is possible that helps them architect situations that bring the portrait to life. Finally, the RBS portrait leads to personal expressiveness, which gives individuals affective resources that can nourish them as they move down that path to ward becoming extraordinary.

However, we see theo retical complications of the story as invitations to conduct important theoretical and empirical extensions in the future. Four complications serve as invitations to future research: (1) the timing of jolts, (2) the quality of one's relation ship with feedback givers, (3) the degree of dis crepancy between others' reflections and one's own image of the RBS, and (4) the influence of the macro social context on RBS composition. In this paper we have described the mecha nisms that enable the revision of the RBS por trait. We invite further research that considers mechanisms that limit or expand the likelihood that a jolt will trigger a positive change in the RBS portrait. Barriers to RBS revision may arise from the individual, the organization, or their interaction, complicating the growth trajectory of individuals through the RBS revision process. For example, as we noted earlier, one's stage in life or career may affect the revision process. When people are aware that they are at a tran sitional period (Levinson, 1985), such as a This content downloaded from 62.122.79.90 on Wed, 18 Jun 2014 10:47:46 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions === Page 18 === 728 Academy of Management Review October midlife transition or adaptation to a new role (Ibarra, 1999), they may be particularly open to the information and potential a jolt provides. However, when the transition occurs in a poten tially threatening organizational context, people may see a jolt experience as jeopardizing a ten uous position within the organization. For exam ple, an associate who is being considered for partner at her firm may be quite overwhelmed with feelings of uncertainty and doubt. Instead of viewing a challenging assignment as a de velopmental opportunity, she may consider it the final test of her competence, making her more vulnerable to \"choking under pressure\" (Baumeister & Showers, 1986), rather than seeing a new opportunity to exercise and develop her strengths. Thus, one such potential barrier to revision may be the timing of the jolt in relation to one's location in a developmental trajectory. Another possibility is that people may not have the individual capacity or social resources to integrate the jolt experience if they have just revised their RBS. For example, after the associ ate described above is promoted, she may turn her attention away",

In future research scholars need to consider how this process unfolds dif ferently for people at different developmental stages. A second complication involves consideration of how reflections from different people have more or less impact on the revision of the RBS. Our analysis suggests that variance in other people's structural and emotional significance affects the degree to which their reflections are incorporated into the self-revision process. Fu ture research might test how the connection quality between people affects the level of im pact of reflected appraisals on the RBS revision process. For example, if the relationship between two people is marked by authenticity and mutuality, then one person's reflected appraisal might strongly impact the other's RBS portrait, because both people experience the connection as one in which they are fully known and understood by the other and in which they can engage in fuller self-disclosure (Dutton & Heaphy, 2003; Miller & Stiver, 1997). If a relationship lacks authenticity and mutuality, then cynicism and lack of trust may lead individuals to discount the positive feedback that they receive from significant oth ers and to view the feedback as insincere, inac curate, or irrelevant to their identity. Research shows that individuals are prone to focus on negative information (e.g., competency gaps) and to subvert positive information (e.g., strengths), given that negative emotions often tend to have a stronger impact on psychological functioning than positive emotions (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, & Vohs, 2001). Imagine the subordinate whose boss tells him he did a fantastic job with his recent quarterly report, after demeaning and threatening him for weeks about completing the report on time. The likeli hood that the subordinate will incorporate this feedback into his RBS portrait is extremely low. In addition, the level of identification that someone feels with a person providing a reflec tion should affect its level of impact on the self revision process (Ibarra, 2003). For example, role models, mentors, or people with whom one iden tifies are likely to affect the revision of the RBS portrait more strongly. Identification with a mentor means that an individual already sees him/herself as similar to the mentor and projects movement toward",

This form of connection may en able an individual to integrate RBS feedback more easily from someone with whom the indi vidual identifies than from someone with whom he or she identifies less. By identifying with each other, individuals may come to know them selves through their relationships with one an other (Kaplan, 1984). At the same time, there are instances in which a high-quality connection with a feedback giver might actually inhibit, rather than enable, the revision of the RBS. For example, Ibarra (2003) argues that changes in self-identity often re quire new connections, because old connections (particularly strong connections) may bind peo ple to old ways of viewing themselves. The qual ity of the connection may be considered both a potential enabling mechanism and a potential interfering mechanism for revising the RBS. Thus, a fruitful direction for future research in volves developing and testing how the qualities of the connection that one has with feedback givers shape the RBS revision process.

A third complication involves specifying the extent to which inaccurate or inconsistent per ceptions of reflected appraisals affect the im pact of an appreciative jolt on the RBS. It is important to acknowledge that people may send each other inaccurate information about their strengths and capabilities. For example, some people might use stereotypical images of social identity groups to form the basis of their as sumptions about who one should be at one's best (e.g., women as nurturing, men as forceful and commanding during a crisis), and they may impose such expectations on others (see Acker, 1990; Darley & Fazio, 1980; Snyder & Stukas, 1999) rather than share feedback about who one actu ally is at one's best. In future research scholars should investigate whether there is an optimal degree of positive discrepancy between one's current RBS portrait and the feedback one re ceives from one's social context regarding one's RBS. Even though a jolt inherently implies a dis crepancy or disruption, when one receives feed back that is too discrepant from the",

Yet revision of the RBS hinges on learning new information about one's strengths and capabilities. If one were only to receive information that confirmed one's current portrait of the RBS, this portrait would become more rigid and narrow, rather than more vivid, sub stantive, or expansive. Research shows that individuals are able to live with contradictions in their self-concept, given that they are only aware of a small part of self-knowledge (i.e., the phenomenal self) at any point in time (Baumeister, 1999). They can also sustain a small number of positive illusions (i.e., beliefs about the self that are not necessarily true), because such illusions afford heightened motivation and persistence (Taylor & Brown, 1988). In fact, research suggests that the desire for self-enhancement or favorable information about oneself is stronger than the desire for con sistent or accurate knowledge about oneself, at least for most individuals (Baumeister, 1999). These distinctions suggest that it is important to examine the extent to which enhancing yet dis crepant reflected appraisals spark revisions to the RBS portrait. The above cited research on self-verifying versus self-enhancing feedback il lustrates the need for specification of the condi tions under which an individual will internalize versus reject social information about his or her RBS. Finally, a fourth complication involves elabo rating and testing how the organizational con text affects revisions to the RBS portrait. In our model we have focused on the power of jolts and resources in explaining the level of change in self-knowledge, but numerous opportunities for extension are possible. For instance, research ers could examine how reward systems and or ganizational culture affect the content and structure of people's RBS, as well as shape how they change over time. For example, some orga nizations institutionalize practices (such as re ward schemes or appreciation rituals) that make developing and \"growing\" their employees an important activity. In these kinds of organiza tional contexts, people receive frequent and elaborate feedback about the value that they contribute to others and to the work of the orga nization. The care-enabling infrastructure of such contexts cultivates a care-conducive cul ture that promotes employee growth and self redefinition (McAllister & Bigley, 2002). In these kinds of contexts, changes in self knowledge that are consistent with a revised RBS are likely to be a normal",

At St. Luke's of London, for example, people assume \"Every one is brilliant\" and \"It's a matter of finding their place and allowing them to reach their potential\" (Lewin & Regine, 2000: 261). At Veri fone, growing people and growing the business are assumed to go hand in hand (Lewin & Regine, 2000). In both of these organizations, af firmative practices embedded in formal reward systems and reinforced by informal norms of interpersonal treatment can make upward revi sions of the RBS a natural part of being an or ganizational member. Just as features of organizational contexts could enhance the likelihood of a positive RBS portrait, characteristics of organizational con texts could directly diminish the possibility of this form of self-development. For example, in organizational contexts where it is unsafe to learn from mistakes (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2002), where individualistic achievement trumps col lective achievement, and where silence as op posed to voice is the norm and expected practice This content downloaded from 62.122.79.90 on Wed, 18 Jun 2014 10:47:46 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions === Page 20 === 730 Academy of Management Review October (Morrison & Milliken, 2000), the conditions for revision of the RBS portrait work against the trajectory of becoming extraordinary. In these kinds of contexts, individuals generally are en couraged to conform to uniform standards of \"best\" and are discouraged from drawing on their personal best-self to make unique contri butions to the organization. In addition, jolts may be rare, and socially embedded resources that enable an RBS revision might be in short supply, short-circuiting the possibility of posi tive self-growth through the RBS revision pro cess. In future research scholars should en deavor to build testable hypotheses about what organizational features create the context and process for self-development that move people in the direction of becoming extraordinary. DEVELOPING METHODOLOGIES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH To extend theoretical and empirical accounts of how RBS portraits are composed and revised in organizations, researchers must develop ap propriate methodologies to capture the nature of the RBS and changes in the RBS. First, research ers must develop measures that capture the structure and content of the RBS.

The next useful step might be to identify whether there is a common structure among in dividuals' RBS portraits by conducting content analyses of several RBS portraits. Such analyses should capture aspects of the RBS that are com mon across portraits, without losing the unique combination of qualities and experiences that make the RBS distinctive within individuals. Further, the theory we present in this article represents a dynamic process of individuals' ac tive composition of the RBS. As such, we are presented with a need for methods that can rep resent changes in an individual's construal of the RBS over time. One way of approaching this problem might be to capture participants' no tions of the self through descriptive measures, such as \"I am\" statements (Kuhn & McPartland, 1954), or through relational mapping (Josselson, 1996) before and after a jolt intervention, and analyzing the differences between the portray als of the RBS. We also propose that jolts can vary in magnitude, from a subtle comment or smile to a grand event in a public forum. This implies that one should also measure the mag nitude of change in the RBS portrait, ranging from incremental changes to radical transfor mations, in response to minor versus major jolts. Such methods may help researchers to under stand how jolts of particular magnitudes and/or qualities produce systematic changes in RBS portraits. A third area for methodological development involves finding valid ways to measure the re sources available to an individual at the time he or she faces new information and images of who he or she is at his or her best. Our theory sug gests that emotional, relational, and agentic re sources act alone and in combination to enable the revision of self-knowledge about one's RBS. Experimental studies may provide a controlled method for studying the effects of resources on the RBS revision process by inducing the amount and type of resources available to an individual when he or she confronts a jolt. Re search could also pursue a nonexperimental route, using a combination of quantitative, qual itative, and ethnographic approaches to dis cover how the perceived presence of resources available to an individual when he or she is exposed to positive self-relevant information in fluences subsequent revisions to the RBS por trait.

In particular, we have described a process by which social expe riences (i.e., jolts) and socially embedded re sources (i.e., positive affect, positive interper sonal relationships, and personal agency) spark and nourish positive shifts in how people envi sion their own sources of strength, competence, and added value.

In partic ular, our theory helps researchers see how the microcontext inside organizations contributes to the creation of difficult-to-imitate, rare, and valuable organizational resources in the form of individuals striving, growing, and developing themselves in ways that move them toward ex cellence and extraordinariness. We see real promise in helping to uncover some of the mi crodynamics through which strategic human re sources are built and sustained. We view the RBS (and the processes that create and direct this important knowledge structure) as a key stone in the sustainable development of strate gic human resources that contribute to an orga nization's capacity to compete effectively over time. Instead of considering human capital as a fixed asset, we describe the dynamic process of creating social contexts where individuals are able to evolve in the direction of their capability and potential (Coleman, 1988; Schultz, 1961). More traditional notions of human resource management are based on two assumptions: (1) organizations benefit by effectively using the human resources they acquire, which suggests that they attempt to employ the \"best\" individu als, and (2) organizations benefit from identify ing and eliminating personal weaknesses in employees. In this paper we present an addi tional means of human resource management: creating contexts that maximize the possibility for employees to envision and enact their best self. In contrast",

Thus, it is im portant to be clear that while organizations can use the RBS portrait for employee development, it is not intended to be a new method of evalu ating people. Instead, we discuss the strategic human resource capacity inherent in helping people discover who they are when they are at their personal best. Implicit in our theory of the RBS is the as sumption that organizations cannot maximize their strategic human resource capacity with a solitary focus on eliminating limitations and weaknesses; organizations must also focus on building the strengths that reside within their employees, systems, and structures (Clifton & Harter, 2003). In line with the Gallup Organiza tion's research on human strengths (Bucking ham & Clifton, 2001; Clifton & Harter, 2003), we posit that organizations experience the greatest gains in human development when they invest in what people do best naturally. We do not encourage organizations to ignore weaknesses, but we do suggest that organizations will be more likely to achieve excellence (via customer loyalty, employee retention, and productivity) when they focus and build on employees' strengths, with only a secondary focus on under standing and managing weaknesses (Clifton & Harter, 2003). Changes in the RBS portrait over time provide one explanatory theory for under standing why a strength-based approach to em ployee development is effective from an individ ual's point of view. We do not consider the resources that enable development to be limited or depleting (e.g., money, time, promotions); instead, we describe socially embedded resources that are regener ated through human development (e.g., positive emotions, positive relationships, personal agency). This view of socially embedded re sources parallels descriptions of social and hu man capital as resources that are generated through use but that depreciate with nonuse (see Adler & Kwon, 2002, for a review). As indi viduals discover their core competencies and draw on these competencies to add value to their social system, the system is enriched, and the core competencies of the organization (Pra halad & Hamel, 1990) are transformed. In this way, the theory of RBS composition maps a microlevel process for individual growth that",

However, it is important to note that although revising the RBS portrait enhances in dividuals' identity, well-being, and action, these changes may not always benefit the organiza tion. If, for example, employees discover that they are unable to actualize their RBS within their current organization, they may seek em ployment with other organizations that will pro This content downloaded from 62.122.79.90 on Wed, 18 Jun 2014 10:47:46 AM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions === Page 22 === 732 Academy of Management Review October vide opportunities for them to enact their RBS more frequently. This theory of RBS composition also has im plications for managing change in organiza tions. We describe both personal and social fac tors that enable the composition of the RBS portrait?the individual and the organization cocreate the context for change through psycho logical, relational, and physical resources. In so doing, we paint a picture of individuals as hav ing personal agency; they proactively negotiate their work identities to determine who they are and what they do. This perspective builds on research on job crafting (Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001), self-development (Ashford & Tsui, 1991), feedback seeking (Ashford, 1986; Ashford, Blatt, & VandeWalle, 2003), and identity construction (Ashforth, 2001; Ibarra, 1999; Rafaeli, Dutton, Har quail, & Mackie-Lewis, 1997) in organizations. Yet work organizations also expand or con strain the possibilities for being extraordinary. They do this by both affecting the pattern of jolts that confront individuals and by affording or denying the resources that contribute to revising the RBS portrait. Creating workplaces where people can be authentic or \"fully there\" (Kahn, 1990, 1992) involves not only facilitating self discovery to discover true sources of strength and competence but also allowing these sources of strength and competence to flourish. Rather than expecting mediocre performance, organi zations that operate by setting stretch goals as part of their business strategy might also expect extraordinary contributions from employees. Thus, our theory suggests that leaders might create high-performing organizations (Collins, 2001; Hamel & Prahalad, 1994; Tichy & Sherman, 1993) by creating high-performing individuals (Spreitzer et al., 1995). For example, consider two organizations that vary systematically in the degree to which their culture values developing employees as part of the core ideology. One organization, vitality, com, sees passion, growth, development, and long-term tenure with the organization as desir",

The other organization, trans action.com, values individuals' direct and regu lar contributions to the bottom line and is unconcerned about development and long-term employment. Work organizations that have cul tures (values, norms, and shared beliefs) that promote employee development are more likely to have more formal and appreciative jolts (such as the RBS intervention), and when employees face challenges, they are more likely to have access to critical resources (e.g., positive affect, positive relationships, and personal agency) for self-revision. In these kinds of organizations, we would expect individuals to flourish as a result of continual revisions of the RBS portrait. While hypothetical, this contrast invites theoretical and empirical exploration of what features of work organizations enable individuals' move ment toward becoming extraordinary. Becoming extraordinary is about a pursuit of potential?a never-ending journey with new joys to uncover. The journey of becoming ex traordinary is ongoing and evolves over time, with no discernible final end state. By under standing how individuals continually evolve into the RBS, without comparing them to other individuals, we can determine how to generate extraordinary contributions and performance in work organizations. The theoretical quest to un derstand and empirically test how organization al contexts help individuals thrive is a direct answer to the call for more studies that extend the field of positive organizational scholarship (Cameron et al., 2003; Dutton, 2003a; Spreitzer, Sutcliffe, Dutton, Sonenshein, & Grant, in press). As such, we encourage the continued pursuit of theory and data that help to uncover pathways toward becoming extraordinary in work organi zations. REFERENCES Acker, J. 1990.

Marshall Goldsmith and Jon Katzenbach coined the term after noticing the feedback process was more successful when FeedForward was added, shifting the focus from rehashing the mistakes of the past to concentrating on the promise of the future. To understand how feedback and FeedForward work together, think of a shopping mall map and the little arrow pointing to “You Are Here.” Feedback is the arrow showing you where you are in key relationships. FeedForward is the map that directs you to where you want to be in your professional and personal relationships. FeedForward has other benefits. Imagine the boss calls you and says, “Please come into my office. I have some feedback for you.” Your first reaction is not likely to be, “Oh goody! Fun, fun, fun!” Actually, fun is the last word that",

More than 80,000 people who have gone through the FeedForward process say it is positive, helpful, and, yes, fun. Why? Because: • FeedForward is focused on a future you can change, not a past you cannot change. • There is no judging or critiquing of the person or ideas. • You learn from a diverse perspective. • You can really listen because you don’t feel defensive. • No feedback about the past (and all of the emotional baggage that comes with it) is allowed. • It creates a rich pool of ideas with less work. www.sccoaching.com WHAT IS FEEDFORWARD? 4 === Page 6 === www.sccoaching.comHOW DOES FEEDFORWARD WORK? === Page 7 === HOW DOES IT WORK? The steps in our FeedForward process are: 1. Get 360° Feedback 2. Pick a Behavior 3. Respond 4. Involve 5. Follow Up Let’s get started… GET 360° FEEDBACK Getting feedback will create a more complete picture of yourself from the perspective of those around you. If you have never asked others to complete a feedback survey about you, or been asked to give one, then you must realize getting or giving this kind of honest feedback can make some people feel uncomfortable. It’s important to remind those around you that what they say is confidential and anonymous. Next, to better prepare those you will be asking to participate in your feedback, we have a form explaining how it will all work so they feel more comfortable with the process and understand their role, your expectations and the level of commitment you are asking of them. You’ll find this Feedback Participant Preparation Sheet in the Additional Resources section of this book. Where do you find a 360° feedback survey? Your company may have one already. If it doesn’t, here is one you can try: • https://sccoaching.com/gla-360-assessment/ In each case, once you are on the site, ask the company to help you find a 360° feedback survey that’s right for you. They will walk you through the process and let you know their costs. www.sccoaching.com 6 === Page 8 === PICK A BEHAVIOR RESPONDAfter you have gotten feedback, the next step is to Pick a Behavior to improve.

If you are working with a coach, he or she will interview your key stakeholders and share a complete analysis with you. You, your coach and key stakeholders will then sign off on the one behavior that, when improved, would make you more successful. If you’re going it alone, follow the same steps except for interviewing your stakeholders. Using the feedback you’ve received, and consulting the 20 Behaviors list, you will be able to narrow your selection down to two or three. From there you can ask your key stakeholders to vote on which behavior you should choose, or just pick one and move on to the next step. The next step in our process is Respond. Respond sets the stage for change and signals a turn ahead. Here’s how it works. You begin by writing a “speech” that you’ll be giving your key stakeholders (the people you asked for feedback). Make sure to include these elements : First — thank the person for giving you feedback. Second — mention your strengths listed in the feedback. Third — advertise the one behavior you’d like to improve. Fourth — apologize for the impact of this behavior. Fifth — ask for ideas and suggestions to improve for the future. (FeedForward) Important thoughts : Your response “speech” should be positive, simple, focused and fast. Advertise is a vital strategy that starts in this phase and continues into the Involve and Follow Up phase. As you’ll read about it later, it’s a BIG key to why this process works. Apologizing creates closure so you and those around you can move on. I’m often asked, “Do you get those big CEOs to apologize?” The answer is yes. If they don’t, I won’t work with them. It’s that important! www.sccoaching.comHOW DOES IT WORK? 7 === Page 9 === Here is a sample response : “Mr. Co-Worker, I just got this 360° feedback. The first thing I’d like to say is thank you very much for participating in this process. I really appreciate it. Next, a lot of my feedback is very positive— ethical, dedicated, hardworking, caring about our company and our customers. I want to say how grateful I am about all of this positive feedback that I have received. “AND there is something I would like to improve. In the past, I have come off",

Please accept my apologies. And Mr. and Ms. Co- Worker, please give me some ideas to help me be a more positive and open-minded listener in the future.” Write your speech : www.sccoaching.com HOW DOES IT WORK? 8 === Page 10 === INVOLVE This next step gets the key stakeholders in your life involved in your improvement. Involve begins with something leaders struggle with—asking for help. Peter Drucker said, “The leader of the past knew how to tell. The leader of the future knows how to ask.” Ask your key stakeholders for ideas or suggestions on how to execute the new behavior. Don’t ask for feedback about the past. Ask for FeedForward ideas to put into practice for the future. When your stakeholders are engaged in your progress, they are more likely to offer the positive reinforcement you will need when your energy and commitment are low, and that will challenge you to grow. www.sccoaching.com Regarding suggestions from stakeholders Whatever that person says, listen. Take notes, and say, “Thank you.” Do not judge or critique in any way. Just say, “Thank you.” And write down the person’s suggestions. Let the person know that you may not be able to try all ideas, but you will commit to one. (You can’t commit to everything, but you can commit to something) .BONUS TIP FOLLOW UPHOW DOES IT WORK? 9After seventeen years of research on this topic, we know who changes and who does not, why people change, and why they do not. The key to making change last is to follow up and stick with it. Follow-up is important not only to change our behavior but to change perception. People sometimes wonder, “Do leaders really change their behavior or are they merely perceived as changing because they do all this follow-up?” Answer: It is much more difficult to change another person’s perception than it is to change our behavior. One research principle in psychology is called “cognitive dissonance theory.” Summed up, it means we view people in a manner that’s consistent with our previous stereotype. If I have a stereotype of you that says you’re a bad listener, I’m going to look for that bad listener in whatever you do or say, and that will reconfirm my",

Situation A : Say I get feedback that indicates I make too many destructive comments. I don’t talk to my co-workers, I don’t follow up, and I don’t advertise what I’m looking to improve. I think, “All I need to fix this is to quit making the comments, and the problem will go away.” Wrong. Here’s why this doesn’t work. Let’s say that I go seven months without making a destructive comment about anyone. After seven months I slip and make a destructive comment. You’re my co-worker, you hear me, what’s your first reaction? “Marshall hasn’t changed.” That one negative comment, even though it’s my first in seven months, will cue your previous negative stereotype and you will believe I have not changed. Situation B : I’ve gotten feedback. I want to do a better job of being a great team player, not making destructive comments. You’re my co-worker, and you don’t necessarily believe I’m going to change, but you pretend to go along with it and take notes. What happens, though, when I follow up and re-advertise a month later? I say, “Remember, I said I wanted to do a great job of being a great team player, not making destructive comments. It’s been a month. Based on my behavior last month, give me some ideas for how I can improve for next month.” Every month I follow up, advertise what I’m trying to improve, you share ideas, and this goes on for several months. One day I say, “Those stupid idiots in finance, idiot accountants.” You hear me. You come to me and say, “Marshall, you’ve been doing so well. You went eight months without doing that.” I say, “You’re right, my apologies.” In situation A, did my behavior change? Yes. Did the other person’s perception change? No. In situation B, did my behavior change? Yes. Did the other person’s perception change? Yes. In leadership, it’s not what you say that counts; it’s what they hear that counts. Here is a sample script for doing follow-up and advertising. The same guidelines apply as before —no criticizing or judging the ideas offered, and keep it positive, fast, and focused: “Mr. Co-Worker, last month",

We do not spend enough time teaching leaders what to stop.” Here’s a list of 20 of the most common behaviors that keep leaders from functioning effectively. Read through the list; you may find some habits that you recognize are not helpful in your life. The list will help you Pick a Behavior (step two in the Feedforward process) that you are going to work hard to improve. 1. Winning too much —If it’s important, we want to win. If it’s meaningful, we want to win. Trivial, we want to win. Not worth it, we want to win anyway. Successful people like to win; it’s just that we like to win TOO much.

You think it’s a great idea, but rather than saying it’s great, your natural tendency is to say, “That’s a nice idea. Why don’t you add this to it?” The problem is that the quality of the idea may go up five percent, but my commitment to its execution goes down by fifty percent. Why? Because it’s no longer my idea. David Ulrich says, “Effectiveness of execution is a function of two things: the quality of the idea times one’s commitment to make it work.” So when we get wrapped up in improving the quality a little bit, we damage the commitment a lot. 3. Passing too much judgment —the need to rate others and impose our standards on them. As we talk about FeedForward, four words to remember are “Help More” and “Judge Less.” The key to not passing judgment is to take a deep breath and look in the eyes of that person and ask yourself, “What’s more important, this little judgmental comment I’m about to make, or my relationship with this human being?” If we have the discipline to stop and think, you know what we learn? That little comment we’re about to make really doesn’t matter. But our relationship with that human being matters a whole lot. 4. Destructive comments —sarcastic comments and remarks made at the expense of others. Starting with negative qualifiers such as “No”, “But” or “However” unconsciously say to everyone, “I’m right. You’re wrong!” I once coached a CIO. While reviewing his feedback report, he looked at me and said “But, coach.” I said, “That is free. If you ever speak to me again and you start a sentence with no, but, or however , I’m going to fine you twenty dollars for charity.” He said, “But, coach.” I said, “Twenty.” “No.” “Forty.” “No, no, no.” “Sixty, eighty, a hundred.” He lost four hundred twenty dollars in an hour and a half. www.sccoaching.com20 BEHAVIORS 15 === Page 17 === At the end of an hour and a half, what did he say to me? “Thank you.” He said, “I had no idea. I did that twenty one times with you throwing it in my face. How many times would I have done it had you not been",

No wonder people think I’m stubborn.” This guy got better at stopping destructive comments just by using a simple technique: Don’t start sentences with no, but, or however. Along the way, he also became a better listener. 5. That’s great, but... This is subtly different from number four and number ten, enough so it needed its own place on the list. This “but” is the KING of all “buts” because is combines the attributes from destructive comments and withholding recognition—leaving those around you feeling dismissed. “But” is a real morale breaker and innovation destroyer. If your company is working toward creating a more innovative culture, then get serious about removing the word from your leadership team’s vocabulary and watch what happens. 6. Telling the world how smart we are —the need to show people we’re smarter than they think we are. I remember another CIO who got this one as feedback. He struggled for months to find an effective way to deal with it. Finally, during a FeedForward session, I asked, “What’s so important about telling people how smart you are even when you know it’s damaging your relationship and effectiveness?” He answered, “I feel like a phony, and if I don’t keep telling people how smart I am, they may figure out I am a phony.” I told him, “Believe it or not, people already know how smart you are. What they don’t know is how smart you think they are.” He did a brave thing to break his habit: He asked his team to give him a signal when it was happening. Then he would say two things he thought were smart about the person he was with. It changed his life! 7. Speaking when angry or out of control —using emotional volatility as a management tool. When we get angry and start speaking when we’re out of control, it helps to take a deep breath, look in the mirror and ask ourselves a couple of hard questions: “How much of this problem is out there? How much of this problem is in here?” Eighty percent of the time, you know what we’re going to learn? When we speak when we’re angry or out of control the solution isn’t out there. It’s inside us. 8. Negativity, or “Let me explain why that won’t work” —the need to share our negative thoughts even when",

I was shocked recently when I read a study showing the average American is spending fifteen hours a month complaining about upper management. I thought, “That’s impossible.” Since I didn’t do the research, I concluded they must be wrong. Guess what? I interviewed my first two hundred clients and you know what I learned? They were exactly right. I am amazed how much of our lives get wasted critiquing other people, or complaining about upper management.20 BEHAVIORS www.sccoaching.com 16 === Page 18 === Because we often confuse disclosure with honesty, we excuse inappropriate or unnecessary disclosure by saying, “But it’s honest.” There are a thousand honest things we can say that we don’t have to say. I may not like one of my co-workers, but I don’t have to tell the world about it. A CEO was coaching one of her direct reports and the direct report complained about something. The CEO said, “Have you ever gone to a Broadway play and watched one of the actors in the middle of the play say, ‘Oh, by the way, I have a hurt foot today, and I’ve got a headache, and my aunt died last week, and I have a cold and isn’t it too bad?’” “Of course not,” the direct report replied. “You know why the actor doesn’t complain?” the CEO said. “Because that person is a professional.” Before you speak, ask yourself: Is this a comment a professional would make in this job? The CEO went on to give the direct report this helpful technique: As a leader, every day you go out, it’s show time. Everybody is looking at your face, they’re listening to your comments, and they’re looking at you for inspiration. Don’t whine, don’t complain, and don’t make excessive negative comments. Every day when you go to work, say, “I’m going to be up. I’m going to be positive. I’m going to make a difference today.” 9. Withholding information —refusing to share information so that you gain or maintain an advantage over others. Here’s a way for managers to improve communication and let your team know that you aren’t holding back any information they need. Once a quarter, have a one-on-one dialogue with each of your direct reports using these six questions:20 BEHAVIORS www.sccoaching.comQuestion #1 : Where are we going? If you’re the manager, say, “Here’s where I see us going and here",

I would say, “Here’s where I see you and your part of the business going,” and then ask, “Where do you think you and your part of the business should be going?” These first two questions create alignment two ways—one with the manager and the team member, and two with the larger picture and the smaller picture. Question #3 : Tell the person, “Here’s what I think you’re doing well.” Then ask that person, “What do you think you’re doing well?” A lot of times we don’t recognize other people enough, not out of maliciousness but out of ignorance. We don’t recognize what they’ve done because we actually don’t know. 17 === Page 19 === 10. Failing to give proper recognition —the inability to praise and reward. One of the fastest ways a manager can demotivate a team is to have no clue about the unique level of contribution each individual has made on a project— let alone not verbalize it. A CEO I worked with, who had an unusually low score in this area, listed each person on his staff and the specific contribution that each person made to him, the company and the customer. As he read the list in our session, he cried as he realized how ungrateful and blind he had been. So he created cards, one for each staff member, listing that person’s contribution to him, the company and the customer. He kept the cards in his back pocket. At random times during the week as he would see people, he would try to remember as much from their card as he could without looking. Ultimately, this CEO could tell every detail of each person’s contribution by heart —and he regularly let them know how much he appreciated it. His commitment to this exercise and the effect it had on the staff helped turn the company from unprofitable to profitable. 11. Claiming credit we don’t deserve —overestimating our contribution to any success. We don’t realize how difficult it is for us to let other people take credit. We also don’t realize how we unconsciously can be perceived as taking this credit ourselves. Say your team comes up with a project and does great work. You’re the manager, so",

Don’t just sit there and think, “Aren’t I wonderful?” Take a second, acknowledge what your team members have done and give them credit. Challenge yourself by making a list of all the people you work with. Ask yourself, “What are my biggest achievements?” Then, for each of these achievements, ask yourself a tough question: “How much of this was because of me and how much of this was because of somebody else? How much of this is where I deserve the credit or how much of this is an area where they should get the credit?” Go out of your way to share the credit, or even to give credit and not take any for yourself.20 BEHAVIORS www.sccoaching.com 18Question #4: Offer suggestions for improvement. Give the person positive ideas of how they can do things better in the future and ask them: “If you were the coach for you, what ideas would you have?” Question #5 : Ask, “How can I help?” Question #6 : Ask, “As a manager, any suggestions for me?” === Page 20 === 12. Making excuses —shifting responsibility to others and repositioning our annoying behavior as a permanent fixture so people will excuse us for it. I’ve seen feedback forms from literally thousands of people evaluating their bosses. How often have I seen leadership feedback that sounds like this: “We think you’re a great leader because we love the quality of your excuses.” Or how about this one: “I really thought you were screwing up but when you made those excuses, that turned it around for me.” Fight the incredible urge to make excuses when you get input, and just learn to shut up and listen. And before you ever start making the excuses, ask yourself this question: “Who am I impressing here?” The answer, in almost every case, is nobody. 13. Clinging to the past —the need to deflect blame away from ourselves and onto events and people from the past. One of the biggest challenges of clinging to the past is saying, “This is the way we’ve always done it” or “That has never worked in the past.” Using the past as kind of an excuse for the future. America experienced a financial meltdown in 2008. One of the reasons was a lot of mathematical models were used to determine the",

These mathematical models were all based on one assumption: What never has happened never can happen. Guess what? Sometimes what never has happened happens. And as soon as this happened in our economy, every mathematical model fell apart. It’s important to keep an open mind. Don’t cling to the past. Look at the future, and ask yourself not just what has happened, but also ask, “What can happen?” 14. Playing favorites —failing to see we are treating someone unfairly. A CEO I worked with struggled to see how his favorites were costing him his company. One of his favorites would create policies and procedures that drained morale while making his own job easier. Another favorite would work as an “island” on projects that required extensive collaboration, conveniently omitting information that the group needed—just so he could maintain his position. How did this go on, you ask? Simple. They were good suck-ups. Here are some guidelines on how to avoid playing favorites and encouraging suck-ups. First, rank your direct reports, in order, in each of the following categories:20 BEHAVIORS www.sccoaching.com 191. How much do they like me? Now, you don’t know how much they like you. What’s important isn’t what you know; it’s what you think. We all say we hate suck- ups. What we really hate are blatant suck-ups, obvious suck-ups, and embarrassing suck-ups. We hate bad suck-ups. We like those good suck-ups that don’t really look like they’re sucking up. === Page 21 === If we’re honest with ourselves, too often our willingness to give recognition is more highly correlated with number one, \"Do they like me?\" or number two, \"Do they remind me of myself?\" than it is with number three, \"What kind of job are they doing for this company? 15. Refusing to express regret —the inability to take responsibility for our actions, admit we were wrong, or acknowledge how our actions affect others. One of the greatest things a leader can say when they make a mistake is, “I’m sorry.” What happens when leaders stand up, admit what they did wrong, express regret and ask people to help them? Does people’s respect for them go down? No. It goes up! We all screw up sometimes. Don’t hide from it. Apologize. By the way, this isn’t just true at work; it’s true at home.

So far, I’ve never had a client with nobody’s name on that list. 16. Not listening. Peter Drucker says, “One of the common qualities of great leaders is they are great listeners.” Well, listening sounds simple. It’s often not as easy as we think and we often make mistakes in listening. And a lot of it isn’t just what we say, it’s how we look. Let me ask you a question. Has anyone ever looked at you and said, “You’re not listening, you’re not listening”? Well, my guess is the answer to that is probably a big yes. How many of us have then said, “What do you mean, I’m not listening?” and repeated what the other person said verbatim to prove they were wrong? Well, did this really improve your relationship with that other human being? I don’t think so. Next time somebody looks at you and says, “You’re not listening,” you know what you’re going to say? “I’m sorry. Please accept my apologies. I’m going to try to do better.” Because, you see, even if we were listening, how much of an “I care about you” message were we sending to that other person by contradicting them? Zero. What’s the other person really saying? “Why don’t you care?\"20 BEHAVIORS www.sccoaching.com 202. How much are they like me? How much do they remind me of that ever-so- special me? It sounds like this: “Ah, he’s a jerk, but he’s an engineer.” Or to put it another way, “Fine person, but he’s not an engineer.” What’s the message? If you’re not an engineer, you don’t have a brain. 3. What is their contribution to our company and our customers? 4. How much positive personal recognition do I give them? === Page 22 === So, two important qualities of listening: 1) Listen . Listen to hear what people have to say. Fight the urge to talk or express our opinions when other people speak to us. Learn to shut up and do some other things we’ve talked about, like say thank you to them for having the guts to tell us the truth. 2) Look like you’re a good listener . Show that by the way you react and the way you sound; communicate a message to the other human being that",

To do a better job of recognizing people, try this: Make a list of the key people that impact your life—friends, family, direct reports, co-workers, key customers. Twice a week—once on Wednesday and once on Friday—look at that list and ask yourself: Did anybody on this page do something I should recognize? If they did, send them an e-mail, voicemail, or little note and say thank you. If they didn’t, don’t do anything. You don’t want to look like a hypocrite or a phony. 18. Punishing the messenger —a misguided need to attack the innocents who are only trying to help us. Another client struggled with hearing feedback. And by struggle, I mean he fired people who spoke the truth for very long. It was so bad; his direct reports gave him the nickname Emperor—like the one from the children’s story who had no clothes. What was he teaching the staff ? If you want to survive here, don’t tell me the truth. 19. Passing the buck —the need to blame everyone but ourselves. Passing the buck occurs when, say, you have an argument with your manager and at the end of the day your manager says, “Well you want to do X, but we’re going to do Y, and it’s a done deal.” But rather than just go try to make it work, we have a tendency to say, “He made me tell you we’re going to do it this way.” That’s passing the buck, or even worse, “That fool made me tell you we’re going to do it this way.” The problem with passing the buck is if we say, “He made me tell you we’re going to do it this way” or “She made me tell you we’re going to do it this way,” what do our direct reports learn to think of us as leaders? We’re not leaders, just messengers. Even worse, when we say, “That idiot told me we’re going to do it this way,” and basically stab our boss in the back in front of our direct reports, what do we teach our direct reports to do when they disagree with us? Stab us in the back. 20. An excessive need to be me —exalting our faults and virtues simply because they",

None of us have to be a certain way if we don’t want to be. But when we cling to the excuse, “That’s just the way I am,” then that’s the way we stay. 20 BEHAVIORS www.sccoaching.com 21 === Page 23 === One of our client’s feedback report showed he didn’t recognize people well. To which he said, “That’s just the way I am.” Then he asked, “Why do they need so much recognition anyway?” On and on he went. I finally looked at him and said, “If you gave other people better recognition, would they perform more poorly or perhaps better?” He responded, “Well, they’d perform better.” “Would customer satisfaction go down or go up?” “It would go up.” “Would you make less money or more money?” “We’d probably make more money.” I finally said, “Can you explain to me again why you are doing a bad job of giving these people recognition?” He looked at me and he said, “Well, that’s just the way I am.” But I think he realized that “just the way I am” didn’t have to be just the way he was. NOTE: Goal obsession —the overarching behavior which underlies all of these behaviors. Goal obsession occurs when we get so wrapped up in achieving a goal that we forget our ultimate mission. My favorite example of this is a fascinating study by a couple of people, Darley and Batson, at Princeton Theological Seminary. They took all these ministers. To half of them they said, “You’re late! Get across campus. You’ve got to deliver a sermon on the topic of the Good Samaritan.” Well, on the way across campus, they plant an actor playing the role of a hurt person. The actor’s going, “I need help. Help me, help me, help me, help me!” Ninety percent of the ministers in Princeton Theological Seminary, when told they were ten minutes late to deliver a sermon on the topic of the Good Samaritan, ignored the pleas of a person in need. In two cases, the actor tries to grab the ministers. In both cases, they brushed the person off and moved on to deliver that sermon. And, by the way, so would we.

What do you hope to accomplish by changing this behavior? 23 === Page 25 === www.sccoaching.comMARSHALL'S BEHAVIORAL COACHING PROCESS === Page 26 === Many of us work in organizations that preach the following sermon: “We want to create an environment where we tear down the silos that isolate us, and build positive, collaborative, win- win relationships with our colleagues.” Yet too often, as leaders, our actions don’t line up with this corporate happy talk. Worse, no one holds us accountable (primarily because of a silent cultural norm called “Say Nothing About It,” which leaders help create and perpetuate). This accountability breakdown creates cynicism, lack of trust and low morale, which sap organizations of energy and momentum. This disconnect, between what our words say is important and what our actions say is important, is a huge frustration for employees. This issue, and many like it, is what behavioral coaching addresses. While the coaching process can improve consistency—which will restore faith in the leadership of the organization—the following conditions must be in place: If these conditions exist, the behavioral coaching process is set up for success!The person who is being coached must make a sincere effort to change. Behavioral coaching only works if you are willing to make the needed commitment. The organization has faith in the process and the individual who is going through that process, and will create an environment to support that person. If not, don’t bother going through this process. The person going through the coaching process has the intelligence or functional skills to do the job. If a manager does not have the capacity or experience required, don’t expect behavioral coaching to help. This process won’t turn a bad engineer into a good engineer! The person is committed to the same mission as the organization. Coaching is a “how to get there” process, not a “where to go” process. If the people being coached are headed in the wrong direction, behavioral coaching will only help them get there faster! www.sccoaching.comMARSHALL'S BEHAVIORAL COACHING PROCESS 25 === Page 27 === www.sccoaching.comMARSHALL'S BEHAVIORAL COACHING PROCESS THE STEPS FOR BEHAVIORAL COACHING 1.

Leaders cannot be expected to change behavior if they don’t have a clear understanding of what desired behavior looks like. The people we coach (in agreement with their managers) work with us to determine desired leadership behavior. 2. Involve the leaders being coached in determining key stakeholders. Not only do clients need to be clear on desired behaviors, they need to be clear (again in agreement with their managers) on key stakeholders. There are two major reasons why people deny the validity of feedback: wrong items or wrong raters. By having our clients and their managers agree on the desired behaviors and key stakeholders in advance, we help ensure their “buy in” to the process. 3. Collect feedback. In my coaching practice, I personally interview all key stakeholders. The people I am coaching are all potential CEOs, and the company is making a real investment in their development. However, at lower levels in the organization (which are more price sensitive), traditional 360° feedback can work very well. In either case, feedback is critical. It is impossible to get evaluated on changed behavior if there is not agreement on what behavior to change. 4. Reach agreement on key behaviors for change. As I have become more experienced, my approach has become simpler and more focused. I generally recommend picking only one to two key areas for behavioral change with each client. This helps ensure maximum attention to the most important behavior. My clients and their managers (unless my client is the CEO) agree upon the desired behavior for change. This ensures that I won’t spend a year working with my clients and have their managers determine that we have worked on the wrong thing! 5. Have the coaching clients respond to key stakeholders. The person being reviewed should talk with each key stakeholder and collect additional Feedforward suggestions on how to improve on the key areas targeted for improvement. In responding, the person being coached should keep the conversation positive, simple and focused. When mistakes have been made in the past, it is generally a good idea to apologize and ask for help in changing the future. I suggest that my clients listen to stakeholder suggestions and not judge the suggestions. 6. Review what has been learned with clients and help them develop an action plan. As stated earlier, my clients have to agree",

I just ask them to listen to my ideas in the same way they are listening to the ideas from their key stakeholders. I then ask them to come back with a plan of what they want to do. These plans need to come from them—not me. After reviewing their plans, I almost always encourage them to live up to their own commitments. I am much more of a facilitator than a judge. I usually just help my clients do what they know is the right thing to do. 7. Develop an ongoing follow-up process. Ongoing follow-up should be efficient and focused. Questions like, “Based upon my behavior last month, what ideas do you have for me next month?” Keep the focus on the future. Within six months conduct a two- to six-item mini-survey with key stakeholders. They should be asked whether the person has become more or less effective in the areas targeted for improvement. 8. Review results and start again. If the person being coached has taken the process seriously, stakeholders almost invariably report improvement. Build on that success by repeating the process during the next twelve to eighteen months. This follow-up will assure continued progress on initial goals and uncover additional areas for improvement. Stakeholders will appreciate the follow-up. No one minds filling out a focused, two- to six- item questionnaire if they see positive results. The person being coached will benefit from ongoing, targeted steps to improve performance. While behavioral coaching is only one branch in the coaching field, it is the most widely used type of coaching. Most requests for coaching involve behavioral change. While this process can be very meaningful and valuable for top executives, it can be even more useful for high-potential future leaders. These are the people who have great careers in front of them. Increasing effectiveness in leading people can have an even greater impact if it is a twenty- year process, instead of a one-year program. Finally, people often ask, “Can executives really change their behavior?” The answer is definitely yes. If they didn’t change, we would never get paid (and we almost always get paid). At the top of major organizations,",

From an organizational perspective, the fact that the executive is trying to change anything (and is being a role model for personal development) may be even more important than what the executive is trying to change. One key message that I have given every CEO that I coach is “To help others develop—start with you!”THE VALUE OF BEHAVIORAL COACHING FOR HIGH-POTENTIAL LEADERS 27 === Page 29 === www.sccoaching.comADDITIONAL RESOURCES === Page 30 === www.sccoaching.comCOACHING TIPS Tip #1: It's Not About You One of the greatest lessons I’ve learned about coaching over the years is that it’s not about me. It’s about the clients. You know, the client I coached who improved the most is the client I spent the least amount of time with. He told me, “I manage 50,000 people and my job is no different than yours. If these are not great people, I’m not going to get great results. That’s why every day when I come to work, I tell myself, ‘Leadership is not about me. Leadership is about them.’” This CEO taught me a valuable, humbling lesson. He said, “Don’t make the coaching process about you. Make it about your clients and everyone around your clients. The way your coaching process works, if you have the right clients, you will always succeed. If you have the wrong clients, even God’s not going to succeed. Don’t make it about you. Make it about getting great clients.” What did I say to him? “Thank you very much.” Tip #2: They Have to Care When does behavioral coaching not work? When people don’t care. Have you ever tried to change the behavior of a husband, wife or partner who had absolutely no interest in changing? How much luck did you have there? Don’t coach people who don’t care. My mother was a first grade school teacher. In my mother’s mind, I was always in the first grade, my father was in the first grade, all of our relatives were in the first grade—and she corrected us like we were in the first grade. With my dad, she sounded like this... “Bill, Bill, Bill!” How irritating and annoying! Well, we ended up getting a talking bird. You guessed it, after a while, the bird starts going, “Bill, Bill, Bill!” Now old dad’s being corrected by a bird. He’s",

Behavioral coaching only works with people who care. Tip #3: It’s Got To Be Behavioral Behavioral coaching only solves behavioral problems. I get ridiculous requests for coaching. A pharmaceutical company called me up, “Marshall, we want you to coach Dr. X.” I said, “Great. What’s his problem?” They said, “He’s not updated on recent medical technology.” I said, “Neither am I.” Behavioral coaching can’t make a bad doctor a good doctor or a bad scientist a good scientist. Behavioral coaching only helps people with behavioral issues. 29 === Page 31 === w w w . s c c o a c h i n g . c o mCOACHING TIPS Tip #4: You Fire Integrity Issues, Not Coach ’Em Never coach an integrity violation. You fire integrity violations, not coach them. How many integrity violations does it take to ruin the reputation of your company? Um, that would be. . . one. Sometimes it’s just the wrong person in the wrong company in the wrong job. When that happens, you know the best thing you can do? Encourage them to leave. Because when you do behavioral coaching you’re not helping them be a better professional, you’re helping them be a better phony. It’s not really them. In other cases, people get written off by upper management and they’re not going to be given a fair chance and the companies don’t have enough guts to fire them. They do this phony behavioral coaching. It’s not really about development or behavior. If you want to help people, help them. If you want to fire people, fire them. Don’t jerk them around. Tip #5: Get Clear I begin by getting a clear contract with my clients. If I coach my clients, they will receive confidential feedback from everyone around them; they will pick important behavior to improve; and they will follow up, apologize for previous mistakes, involve their co-workers, and get measured twice. If they refuse to do these things, I don’t work with them. Again, in my coaching process, I don’t get paid if my clients don’t get better, period. Tip #6: Internal Coaches Three conditions must exist for internal coaching to work. One, credibility: the",

Two, confidentiality: the client has to believe the coaching is confidential and won’t be used against them later in a performance appraisal discussion. Three, time: it takes time to build the reputation of having the first two. If the internal coach is given the credibility and can be seen doing coaching in a confidential way, and given the time, there is no reason why internal coaches cannot be just as effective as external coaches. The key to their success: they coached only high-potential future leaders and not people who were going to be fired. 30 === Page 32 === w w w . s c c o a c h i n g . c o mTip #7: Don’t Be Condescending One of the mistakes a lot of people with behavioral training make is that we come off as overly empathetic and almost talk down to our clients. This overly sensitive, I’m-in-touch- with-your-pain approach can be a huge turnoff to real- world business executives. My clients are adults. These are successful people. I don’t feel sorry for them or pity them. These folks are doing great and just have a couple of things they want to do even better. So don’t come off as “Poor you” or “I feel sorry for you” or “Isn’t this whole process traumatic?” I keep things positive, simple, focused and fast. My clients are executives. That’s what they respond to. They don’t have time for things that are highly complicated. And the last thing they need is the feeling that someone they hired to help them is talking down to them. Tip #8: Work It! One of the biggest struggles for external coaches is marketing and self- promotion. The average income from coaching for someone who says they’re a life or executive coach is very, very low. Some might say $20,000 to $30,000 per year from coaching. A lot of people who are really talented as a life or executive coach are not skilled with personal marketing. Make peace with self-promotion. If you’re going to be an external executive coach, you have to market yourself. And there’s nothing wrong with that. If you think you’re going to have clients just because you do a great job, you make no more sense than a company that thinks it’s going to have clients because it makes",

Any great company has to market itself in the same way that you as an executive coach need to market yourself. My suggestion: Establish a clear identity as a coach. My job is helping successful leaders achieve positive lasting change in behavior for themselves or people on their teams. That’s all I do. Establish a clear brand identity as a coach, figure out who you want to be, focus on being a world authority at that, and don’t be ashamed to promote yourself. Tip #9: Talk Less One thing we often do in coaching is talk too much. It starts with giving you my best idea, then I keep talking and feel the need to give you my second best idea, and on and on, until I’ve given you my seventy-fifth best idea. What happens to the quality of our ideas as we keep babbling? They get worse and worse. People don’t remember our first great idea; they remember our last stupid idea.COACHING TIPS 31 === Page 33 === w w w . s c c o a c h i n g . c o mGROUP EXERCISE INSTRUCTION SHEET Objective: Exchange ideas to support an individual’s identified behavior for change.

In the sharing role, participant offers suggestions to help their partner implement their behavior change in the future. (No dialogue about what has been tried in the past.) In the learning role, participant writes down all ideas to try for the future without judging or critiquing. (No dialogue about if the idea is good, bad or how it hasn’t worked in the past.) Directions: Find a partner. Decide who plays which role first—sharer or learner. Partners have 60 seconds to discuss behavior to be changed. Take 2-3 minutes for idea sharing and writing. Switch roles, and take 2-3 minutes more for sharing and writing. Switch partners and start again. Debrief: What did you learn? What suggestion most expanded your understanding?

Number two: Where are you going? You say, “Here’s where I see you and your part of the business going.” Then ask, “Where do you think you and your part of the business should be going?” These first two questions create alignment two ways. One with the manager and the person, and two with the larger picture and the smaller picture.

You probably spend most of your time on Good Work, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Good Work blossoms from your training, your education, and the path you’ve traveled so far. All in all, it’s a source of comfort, nourishment, and success. There’s a range of Good Work: At one end it’s engaging and interesting work; at the other, it is more mundane but you recognize its necessity and are happy enough to spend some time doing it. === Page 17 === GREAT WORK Great Work is what we all want more of. This is the work that is meaningful to you, that has an impact and makes a difference. It inspires, stretches, and provokes. Great Work is the work that matters. It is a source of both deep comfort and engagement —often you feel as if you’re in the “flow zone,” where time stands still and you’re working at your best, effortlessly. The comfort comes from its connection, its “sight line,” to what is most meaningful to you — not only your core values, and beliefs, but also your aspirations and hopes for the impact you want to have on the world. But Great Work is also a place of uncertainty and discomfort. The discomfort arises because the work is often new and challenging, and so there’s an element of risk and possible failure. Because this is work that matters, work that you care about, you don’t want it to fail. But because it’s new and challenging, there’s a chance that it might. === Page 18 === THE SALES TEAM === Page 19 === “Doing a good job here is like wetting your pants in a dark suit. You get a warm",

All in all, it’s a source of comfort, nourishment, and success. There’s a range of Good Work: At one end it’s engaging and interesting work; at the other, it is more mundane but you recognize its necessity and are happy enough to spend some time doing it. === Slide 7 === Great work Great Work is what we all want more of. This is the work that is meaningful to you, that has an impact and makes a difference. It inspires, stretches, and provokes. Great Work is the work that matters. It is a source of both deep comfort and engagement—often you feel as if you’re in the “flow zone,” where time stands still and you’re working at your best, effortlessly. The comfort comes from its connection, its “sight line,” to what is most meaningful to you—not only your core values, and beliefs, but also your aspirations and hopes for the impact you want to have on the world. But Great Work is also a place of uncertainty and discomfort. The discomfort arises because the work",

Wendy, a talented researcher, was put in charge of the large-scale data analysis required to file an application. She considered several approaches and recommended the one she thought best balanced the need for accuracy and comprehensiveness with the imperative to complete the work quickly and on budget. Her boss, George—the company’s head statistician—agreed with the plan, and together they presented it to the vice president of medical affairs, Don. Although Don would have liked a more thorough approach, he recognized that it would be more expensive, and he signed off on the recommendation. After months of work the analysis failed to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug for the new use, and the application to the FDA had to be scrapped. Reac - tions varied. Don blamed the statistics department, and especially George, for recommending the approach it had taken. George did not think that he and his team were at fault, and he was angry with Don for allowing financial pressures to influ - ence their choice in the first place.

The message is clear: Differ - ent people can see the same events in dramatically different ways. In the workplace this phenomenon is particularly evident when it comes to under performance and failure. An outcome that an employee regards as satisfactory may be seen by his boss as entirely unacceptable. When a project is an unequivocal flop, colleagues disagree over the reasons why. These reactions, and their effect on workplace relationships, often become more problematic than the origi - nal event. As a result, how people respond to negative feedback is of great importance to managers and organizations and is a major determinant of career success. Consider the case of a pharmaceuti - cal company seeking FDA approval for a new use of an existing drug. (Some inappropriate responses to failure can derail your career.

Using data on several hundred thousand managers from every industry sector, we have identified 11 personality types likely to have dysfunctional reac - tions to failure. For example, there is the Skeptical type, who is very smart about people and office politics but overly sensi - tive to criticism and always on the lookout for betrayal; the Bold type, who thinks in grandiose terms, is frequently in error but never in doubt, and refuses to acknowl - edge his mistakes, which then snowball; and the Diligent type, who is hardwork - ing and detail oriented, with very high standards for herself and others, but also a micromanaging control freak who infan - tilizes and alienates subordinates. These types represent roughly 70% of the U.S. population. (See the sidebar “Recognize Your Type. ”) The 11 types can be divided into the three broad categories proposed by the psychologist Saul Rosenzweig in the 1930s, which were based on a test that he had developed to assess anger and frustration. Some people are extrapunitive— prone to unfairly blaming others. Some are impunitive: They",

And some are intropunitive, often judging themselves too harshly and imagining failures where none exist. In our pharmaceutical example, Don, an Excitable type, exemplifies extrapuni - tive tendencies. He takes the statistics team to task instead of accepting any personal responsibility or attributing the failure to the drug itself. Extrapunitive responses are all too common in the busi - ness world. Seemingly every time execu - tives testify before Congress—whether it’s Tony Hayward, then BP’s CEO, disavowing blame for the oil spill, or Richard Fuld, then Lehman Brothers’ CEO, disavowing blame for the financial crisis—they point fingers at any organization except their own.

The chief statistician, George, a Bold type, was impunitive, denying that he and his team had anything to do with the bad outcome. One well-known executive who has been accused of this sort of behavior is Carly Fiorina, a past CEO of Hewlett- Packard. Disgruntled former subordinates have described her as a self-promoting attention seeker who ignored integration challenges and day-to-day operations following HP’s 2002 merger with Com - paq and took no responsibility when the combined company failed to live up to its potential. When the HP board suggested that she delegate greater authority to her team and more power to the heads of key business units, she refused and was subse - quently dismissed. (When HBR contacted Fiorina’s chief of staff about this article, she declined to comment.) Though less common than extrapuni - tive and impunitive personality types, people with intropunitive tendencies can also be problematic. The researcher Wendy, a Diligent type, exhibited this be - havior by taking on excessive blame. This may have been due in part to her gender: Because of their socialization and other cultural influences, women are more likely than men to be intropunitive. The underlying theme of our research is that many managers perceive and react to failure inappropriately and therefore have trouble learning from it—leading to more failures down the road. Many of us have at some point assigned (or avoided) blame in a self-serving way, only to suffer negative fallout; on the flip side, we may take self-criticism too far, resulting in paralysis and stagnation. To foster and thrive in a productive work environment, we need to recognize and overcome these tendencies. how to change Your stripes Fortunately, managers at all levels of organizations, and at any stage of their careers, can fix their flawed responses to failure. Here are some key steps you should take: Cultivate self-awareness. First, it’s important to determine whether you fall into one of the three categories. Several personality tests can help you assess your interaction style. Although the Myers- Briggs Type Indicator is probably the best known, others have more empirical sup - port. One well-established model we’ve found particularly helpful is the Big Five, which measures openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agree - ableness, and neuroticism, along with subfactors of these dimensions. It does a good job of illuminating how",

For example, you may find that you score high on the achievement-striving subfactor of the conscientiousness dimension, indicating that you may become easily distressed if you don’t meet ambitious goals. Or you might score high on the anger subfactor of neuroticism, suggesting a tendency to disproportionately fault others for minor errors and to exaggerate their gravity. (To assess yourself on the five dimensions and their subfactors, you can take the IPIP- NEO test, available free at personal.psu. edu/j5j/IPIP/ipipneo120.htm.) Another useful exercise is to reflect on challenging events or jobs in your career, considering how you handled them and what you could have done better. You might ask trusted colleagues, mentors, or coaches to evaluate your reactions to and explanations for failures. Pay close attention to the subtleties of how people respond to you in common workplace situations, and ask for formal or informal 360-degree feedback; you may be sur - prised at what you discover. For example, one media industry CEO we’ve worked with, an Excitable type, saw no problem with his habit of forcefully and publicly pointing out subordinates’ minor errors. During an executive-coaching process he learned that his employees perceived him as extrapunitive. He realized that they had a more hierarchi - cal worldview than he did and that he had underestimated how criticism from him—the boss—might affect them. He also came to accept that small mistakes should be treated differently from big ones, and that feedback on them should be balanced with encouragement. Self-awareness is also helpful for people in the other two categories. If you find that others often see failure where you don’t or if you have a hard time pinpointing times when you’ve failed, you might be impunitive (or at least risk com - ing across that way). At the other extreme, if you’re constantly anxious about failing or if colleagues often reassure you that things aren’t as bad as you think, you may be intropunitive. Although not everyone has the time, inclination, or resources to get the kind of coaching or counseling necessary to surface and address deep psychological issues with respect to failure and blame, everyone can undertake and benefit from this sort of reflection. Cultivate political awareness. Even if you’ve analyzed your behavior and think that you act appropriately with respect to blame, your colleagues might disagree. As the media industry CEO learned,",

Behavior that was appropriate in the past might be perceived as extrapuni - tive, impunitive, or intropunitive in a new role or company. Whereas self-awareness helps you understand what messages you’re sending, political awareness helps you understand what messages others are receiving. It requires that you know how your organization defines, explains, assigns responsibility for, and attempts to remedy failure. Take the case of a COO who had recently joined a health care nonprofit. As part of a large-scale change effort, he was asked to lead a task force that would identify inefficient processes and make recommendations for improvements. Other members of the executive team were assigned to lead other groups.

When the CEO held a meeting to discuss the various groups’ progress and share their findings, the COO, a Reserved type, simply described his team’s activi - ties, making no mention of their missed deadlines and failure to deliver any results. This made the CEO angry; he perceived the COO’s behavior as impunitive and felt that it set a bad example for the other task forces. Fortunately, the CEO was not a blaming type. After the meeting he privately told the COO that although falling behind schedule might have been unavoidable, he had to take responsibility for the delay. The COO realized that the nonprofit’s culture was different from the cultures he’d experienced at other com - panies. In his previous jobs, leaders were expected to hide their shortcomings, not acknowledge them as a means of show - ing their commitment to improving. The COO had to learn how to criticize himself, appropriately and publicly, in order to suc - ceed in his new job. Political awareness involves finding the right way to approach failure within your specific organization, department, and role. An intropunitive person might be effective at a small, highly collegial company but have to change his ways at a larger, more competitive one, where rivals might take advantage. An extrapuni -tive boss who only slightly softened her criticisms when independently running a sales department might have to tone them down",

Once you’re aware of your bad habits, you can move toward more-open, adaptive re - sponses. The strategies needed can work for any of the dysfunctional types. The first is to listen and communicate. It sounds obvious, but most of us forget to gather enough feedback or sufficiently explain our actions and intentions. Especially when it comes to credit and blame, never assume that you know what others are thinking or that they understand where you are coming from. The second is to reflect on both the situation and the people. At the end of each project or performance cycle, think about things that might have pushed you or others into extrapunitive, impunitive, or intropunitive reactions. How did you respond? How did your colleagues? Was everyone on the same page? If not, why? What effect did situational and interper - sonal factors have on the outcome? The third strategy is to think before you act. When a failure seems to have occurred, don’t respond immediately or impulsively. It’s not always possible to right the wrong, but it’s almost always possible to make things worse by overreacting in a highly charged situation. If you become extra - punitive, others may become impunitive. If you become intropunitive, others may pile on. Take the time to consider several possible interpretations of the event and to imagine various ways you might respond. The fourth strategy is to search for a lesson. Mistakes happen. Sometimes a colleague or group of colleagues is at fault. Sometimes the responsibility lies with you. Sometimes no one is to blame. Look for nuance and context and then create and test hypotheses about why the failure hap - pened, to prevent it from happening again. When the talented chief technology officer of an internet company, a Skeptical type, discovered that his department’s high turnover rate was caused by what employees described as an extrapunitive leadership style, he resolved to use these strategies. Previously he would excori - ate his team if projects ran late or did not achieve their goals, refusing to listen to any explanations. The problem, he now learned, wasn’t that his employees lacked competence; it was that they didn’t always understand his instructions and were afraid to request clarification. So his first step was to check in with them to make sure everyone knew what he wanted.",

He started taking “deep dives” into failed projects, assigning blame only after careful consideration. Because of this approach, staff members began to share more information with him, which helped everyone identify weak - nesses and oversights that had affected results. They also grew more comfortable telling him about minor problems earlier, making the problems less likely to cascade. Morale and productivity improved, and turnover decreased. Let’s look at how these strategies can benefit the other types.

Having insight into their motivational biases and emotional reactions to failure can help you give them feedback in the right way and at the right time—feedback that increases their self-awareness and political aware- ness and ultimately helps them change their ways. Of course, sometimes dys- functional people cannot be influenced; if this is the case with your boss, your best option may be to seek other career oppor- tunities inside or outside your organiza- tion. However, people often conclude too quickly that their bosses can’t change. The chief of staff at an investment firm had an extrapunitive manager, a Cautious type, who was highly success- ful and widely respected in the industry but completely uninterested in personal improvement. Like the CTO described earlier, he gave little direction to his employees and then snapped at them when they failed to meet his deadlines or expectations. Although the chief of staff was not herself a victim of his outbursts, she sympathized with the junior execu- tives who were. She identified one area of constant contention: questions about how to classify investments. The boss typically told staff members to “figure it out, ” and the time they spent doing so often led to delays in their analyses. She came up with a solution (forming a committee to create guidelines, which would then go to the manager for approval) and waited for the right time—when he was in a good mood and not too busy—to present it. He agreed, the committee was appointed, and things went more smoothly. The chief of staff had helped her colleagues and protected her extrapunitive boss from himself. It’s also possible to constructively influence people who have impunitive and intropunitive tendencies. Rather than criticizing his new COO publicly and making him defensive, the CEO at the health care nonprofit gave him supportive coaching. At the pharmaceutical company, George helped Wendy see the broader or- ganizational context for the drug applica- tion’s failure. handling failure and blame the right way is key to managerial success.

How Experts Gain Influence To increase their impact, functional leaders should develop four specific competencies. by Anette Mikes, Matthew Hall, and Yuval Millo n 2006 the risk management chiefs of two British financial institutions—we’ll call them Saxon Bank and Anglo Bank— were in similar situations. Each reported directly to the CEO and had, in theory, the same influence in their organiza - tions. But by 2011 Saxon’s risk manage - ment group, unified around a common purpose, was deeply engaged in critical work throughout the bank, while An - glo’s, divided into two specialized and loosely con - nected groups, had little visibility outside specific areas of expertise. Our close study of these two banks offers lessons for other functional experts in search of influence, from management consultants and internal auditors to HR and marketing executives. We have identified four competencies—trailblazing, toolmaking, team - work, and translation—that help functional leaders or groups in any organization compete for top man - agement’s limited time and attention, and ultimately increase their impact. Saxon and Anglo weren’t twins: Saxon focused on consumer lending in a geographically concentrated, Yuval Millo is a professor of social studies of finance and management account - ing at the university of leicester, in the united Kingdom. mature, and competitive market and was therefore seen as risk-averse.

At Saxon, however, the CRO went further. In her initial years at the bank, she made a habit of spending one day a week talking to staff deep in the organization, and her team mem - bers followed suit. They felt that they had to under - stand the bank’s strategy and the businesses’ opera - tions because, as one senior risk officer explained, “you can’t talk about the risks in the business with - out actually telling the story of what the business is doing. ” In this way, Saxon’s risk management group identified several internal and external issues that corporate needed to consider. Saxon’s CRO also demanded—and was granted— a seat at the weekly executive committee meetings and the monthly board meetings, which gave her visibility and a regular opportunity to assert a risk management perspective in the discussion of im - portant decisions. Moreover, she had direct access to nonexecutive directors, who used her expertise as ammunition with which to challenge top man - agement. As one nonexecutive director commented, “You want to have a really feisty CRO who just tells you the truth—one who calls a spade a spade. ” All those things significantly expanded the group’s mandate.

They scanned the environment and talked to business generators regularly so as to catch wind of developments that could affect their portfolio risk.

Developing tools that help corporate-level executives analyze and interpret those issues is an - other matter. The visibility of Saxon’s CRO in high- level governance forums required her to present her perspective in a distinctive yet accessible language. To do this, she and her group came up with tools such as a quarterly risk report, which was presented to the board. Toolmaking was often the group’s opportunistic response to a perceived issue that warranted further discussion. For example, noticing that the quarterly risk report was prompting forward-looking ques - tions from the board, the group decided to introduce formal future-oriented reporting practices, which in turn led to more new tools: scenario planning tem - plates and early-warning indicators. Anglo’s corporate risk team developed many companywide risk tools for regulatory compliance. The managers, recruited from other banks famed for model-based, heavily quantitative risk management, were concerned about the lack of a common “risk Compliance Champions (strength: toolmaking) play an important regu - latory role but do not shape their or - ganizations’ agendas or actions. their tools reflect mainly their own exper - tise and are therefore not regarded as central to the day-to-day running of the business. anglo’s corporate risk managers are an example.

Saxon’s risk management group, for example, gave divisional managers early versions of the scenario planning templates. The managers could then discuss them with their senior staff, provide feedback, and see their own influence on the final templates. The risk management group also sought out allies and col - laborators in other functions. For example, the sce - nario planning templates were deliberately attached to a planning tool already used by corporate finance, making it much easier to persuade busy managers to adopt them.

Rather, it positioned them as a regulatory requirement of the Basel II capital accords and claimed that they were superior to existing capi - tal measurement practices used in planning and per - formance management. But the business managers were convinced neither of the new tools’ necessity nor of their superiority. As one senior risk manager commented, “The businesses are coming back and saying, ‘Guys, wake up! That’s not the way we run the bank. ’” Anglo’s senior local risk managers were better at teamwork. They understood the sales organiza - tion and were motivated to act in partnership with it; their bonuses depended both on revenue growth and loss minimization. They also had decision au - thority on deals, which gave them a double handle over the sales organization: They could stop enthusi - astic salespeople from taking on overly risky invest - ments and guide them toward desired ones.

Anglo’s local risk managers, as we’ve noted, could communicate well with business unit managers individually. However, they transferred only the knowledge their tools generated, not the tools them - selves. The bank’s corporate risk managers did try to promulgate tools but used technical jargon instead of translating concepts into the “language of the busi - nesses. ” When the group tried to promote economic capital forecasting to provide a common language for aggregating risks at the group level, general manag - ers—who typically used income-statement rather than balance-sheet forecasts to frame their decision making—shunned the idea. patterns of influence In combining all four competencies, Saxon’s risk managers were what we call engaged toolmakers (see the sidebar “Influential Experts”). This helped them gain influence throughout the organization over the five-year period we studied (which hap - pened to coincide with a global financial crisis, mak - ing it even more important for the risk function to have a strong voice). They consistently scanned the company and the external environment for opportu - nities to make a difference and then developed the tools—such as the quarterly risk report, the scenario templates, and the early-warning system—to formal - ize and spread their expertise. While keeping control of the overall design and implementation of these tools, the CRO and her officers incorporated busi - ness managers’ insights and made sure everyone could understand the findings. As a result, the group began to help frame important debates about criti - cal issues, from the performance evaluation of divi - sional heads to Saxon’s response to the credit crisis. In contrast, Anglo’s corporate risk management group was seen as necessary for regulatory compli - ance but not relevant to running the business; the tools it developed did not gain traction. Local risk managers were admired for their knowledge of how the operating units really functioned and had strong connections with local leaders, but their organiza - tional influence was limited to those personal interac - tions.

In some situations, for example, the cultivation of just two competencies might be enough. For experts who interact with business managers by means of spreadsheets, reports, and databases, toolmaking and translation will make their work a natural and welcome part of organizational debate and action. Those who aspire to interact with business manag - ers in a partnership role, without disseminating their tools widely, can use teamwork and translation to re - main relevant and effective. A selective approach to the competencies can help experts raise their profile.

But by making deliberate choices about which opportunities they’ll pursue and which they’ll decline, rather than simply reacting to emer - gencies, leaders can and do engage meaningfully with work, family, and community. They’ve discov - ered through hard experience that prospering in the senior ranks is a matter of carefully combining work and home so as not to lose themselves, their loved ones, or their foothold on success. Those who do this most effectively involve their families in work decisions and activities. They also vigilantly manage their own human capital, endeavoring to give both work and home their due—over a period of years, not weeks or days. That’s how the 21st-century business leaders in our research said they reconcile their professional and personal lives. In this article we draw on five years’ worth of interviews with almost 4,000 execu - tives worldwide, conducted by students at Harvard Business School, and a survey of 82 executives in an HBS leadership course. Deliberate choices don’t guarantee complete control. Life sometimes takes over, whether it’s a parent’s dementia or a teenager’s car accident. But many of the executives we’ve studied—men and women alike—have sustained their momentum during such challenges while staying connected to their families. Their stories and advice reflect five main themes: defining success for yourself, manag - ing technology, building support networks at work and at home, traveling or relocating selectively, and collaborating with your partner. Defining Success for Yourself When you are leading a major project, you determine early on what a win should look like. The same prin - ciple applies to leading a deliberate life: You have to define what success means to you—understanding, of course, that your definition will evolve over time. Executives’ definitions of professional and per - sonal success run a gamut from the tactical to the conceptual (see the exhibit “How Leaders Define Work/Life ‘Wins’”). For one leader, it means be - ing home at least four nights a week. For another, it means understanding what’s going on in the lives of family members. For a third, it’s about having emo - tional energy",

Some intriguing gender differences emerged in our survey data: In defining professional success, women place more value than men do on individual achievement, having passion for their work, receiv - ing respect, and making a difference, but less value on organizational achievement and ongoing learn - ing and development. A lower percentage of women than of men list financial achievement as an aspect of personal or professional success. Rewarding re - lationships are by far the most common element of personal success for both sexes, but men list merely having a family as an indicator of success, whereas women describe what a good family life looks like to them. Women are also more likely to mention the im - portance of friends and community as well as family.

Such narratives and self-concepts serve as motivational goalposts, help - ing people prioritize activities and make sense of con - flicts and inconsistencies. When work and family responsibilities collide, for example, men may lay claim to the cultural nar - rative of the good provider. Several male executives who admitted to spending inadequate time with their families consider absence an acceptable price for providing their children with opportunities they themselves never had. One of these men, poor dur - ing his childhood, said that his financial success both protects his children and validates his parents’ strug - gles. Another even put a positive spin on the breakup of his family: “Looking back, I would have still made a similar decision to focus on work, as I was able to provide for my family and become a leader in my Idea in Brief THE PROBLEM Senior executives in this",

The guilt of missing out. ” Both men and women expressed versions of this guilt and associated personal success with not hav - ing regrets. They often cope by assigning special sig - nificance to a particular metric, such as never miss - ing a Little League game or checking in once a day no matter what. “I just prioritize dinner with my family as if it was a 6 pm meeting with my most important client, ” said one interviewee. Another offered this suggestion: “Design your house right—have a table in the kitchen where your kids can do homework while your husband cooks and you drink a glass of red wine. ” Though expressed as advice, this is clearly her very personal, concrete image of what success at home looks like. Managing Technology Nearly all the interviewees talked about how critical it is to corral their e-mails, text messages, voice mails, and other communications. Deciding when, where, and how to be accessible for work is an ongoing challenge, particularly for executives with families. Many of them cautioned against using communica - tions technology to be in two places at once, insisting on the value of undivided attention. “When I’m at home, I really am at home, ” said one. “I force myself to not check my e-mail, take calls, et cetera. I want to give my kids 100% of my attention. But this also works the other way around, because when I’m at work I really want to focus on work. I believe that mixing these spheres too much leads to confusion and mistakes. ” That last point is a common concern: Always be - ing plugged in can erode performance. One leader observed that “certain cognitive processes happen when you step away from the frenetic responding to e-mails. ” (The history of science, after all, is marked by insights that occurred not in the laboratory but while the scientist was engaged in a mundane task— or even asleep.) Another executive pointed out that 24-hour availability can actually hamper initiative in an organization: “If you have weak people who must ask your advice all the time, you feel important. But there is a difference between being truly important and just not letting",

How do you know when that’s the case? One interviewee made an important dis - tinction between broadcasting information and exchanging and analyzing ideas: “Speaking [on the phone] is easy, but careful, thoughtful listening becomes very challenging. For the most important conversations, I see a real trend moving back to face- to-face. When you’re evaluating multibillion-dollar deals…you have to build a bridge to the people. ”Absent a primary caregiver who stays at home, they see paid help or assistance from extended family as a necessity. The women in our sample are adamant about this. One said, “We hire people to do the more tactical things—groceries, cooking, helping the chil - dren dress—so that we can be there for the most im - portant things. ” Even interviewees without children said they needed support at home when they be - came responsible for aging parents or suffered their own health problems. Deciding when, where, and how to be accessible for work is an ongoing challenge, particularly for executives with families. When it comes to technology in the home, more than a third of the surveyed executives view it as an invader, and about a quarter see it as a liberator. (The rest are neutral or have mixed feelings.) Some of them resent the smartphone’s infringement on family time: “When your phone buzzes, ” one rue - fully noted, it’s difficult to “keep your eyes on that soccer field. ” Others appreciate the flexibility that technology affords them: “I will probably leave here around 4 pm to wrangle my kids, ” said one partici - pant, “but I",

Overall, they view it as a good servant but a bad master. Their advice in this area is quite consistent: Make yourself available but not too avail - able to your team; be honest with yourself about how much you can multitask; build relationships and trust through face time; and keep your in-box under control. Building Support Networks Across the board, senior executives insisted that managing family and professional life requires a strong network of behind-the-scenes supporters. Emotional support is equally essential. Like anyone else, executives occasionally need to vent when they’re dealing with something crazy or ir - ritating at work, and friends and family are a safer audience than colleagues. Sometimes leaders also turn to their personal networks for a fresh perspec - tive on a problem or a decision, because members of their teams don’t always have the distance to be objective. Support at work matters too. Trusted colleagues serve as valuable sounding boards. And many lead - ers reported that health crises—their own or fam - ily members’—might have derailed their careers if not for compassionate bosses and coworkers. The unexpected can waylay even the most carefully planned career. “When you’re young, you think you can control everything, ” one interviewee said, “but you can’t. ” Executives told stories about heart attacks, can - cer, and parents in need of care. One talked about a psychotic reaction to medication. In those situa - tions, mentors and team members helped leaders weather difficult times and eventually return to business as usual. What about mixing personal and professional networks, since executives must draw on both anyway? That’s up for discussion. The men we sur - veyed tend to prefer separate networks, and the women are pretty evenly split.

Those who separate their work lives from their pri - vate lives have many reasons for doing so. Some seek novelty and a counterbalance to work. “If all of your socializing centers around your work life, you tend to experience an ever-decreasing circle of influence and ideas, ” one pointed out. Others want to protect their personal relationships from the churn of the workplace. Many women keep their networks separate for fear of harming their image. Some never mention their families at work because they don’t want to appear unprofessional. A few female executives won’t discuss their careers—or even mention that they have jobs—in conversations outside work. But again, not all women reported such conflict between their professional and personal “selves, ” and several suggested that the tide is turning. One pointed out, “The more women have come into the workplace, the more I talk about my children. ” Traveling or Relocating Selectively Discussions about work/life balance usually focus on managing time. But it’s also critical to manage your location—and, more broadly, your role in the global they had refused to relocate when their children were adolescents. “When children are very young, they are more mobile, ” one explained. “But once they are 12 or 13, they want to be in one place. ” Female executives are less likely than men to be offered or accept international assignments, in part because of family responsibilities but also because of the restrictive gender roles in certain cultures or per - ceptions that they are unwilling to relocate. Our sur - vey results—from a well-traveled sample—jibe with student interviewers’ qualitative findings. Almost none of the men surveyed (less than 1%, compared with 13% of the women) had turned down an interna - tional assignment because of cultural concerns. But for female executives, not all travel is created equal: Gender norms, employment laws, health-care access, and views on work/life balance vary from country to country. One American woman said it requires extra effort in Europe to make sure she doesn’t “come off as being intimidating, ” a concern she attributes in part to being tall. Another woman said that in the Middle East she has had to bring male colleagues to meetings to prove her credibility. Though women in particular have such difficul - ties, international assignments",

Members of both sexes have built gratify - ing careers while grounding themselves in a particu - lar country or even city. However, if travel is undesir - able, ambitious young executives should decide so early on. That way they can avoid getting trapped in an industry that doesn’t mesh with their geographic preferences and give themselves time to find ways other than travel to signal open-mindedness, sophis - tication, skill diversity, and willingness to go above and beyond. (Several executives noted that interna - tional experience is often viewed as a sign of those personal attributes.) “International experience can be helpful, ” one executive observed, “but it’s just as important to have had exposure across the business lines.

Leaders also emphasized the importance of com - plementary relationships. Many said how much they value their partners’ emotional intelligence, task focus, big-picture thinking, detail orientation—in short, whatever cognitive or behavioral skills bal - ance out their own tendencies. And many of those we surveyed consider emotional support the big - gest contribution their partners have made to their careers. Both men and women often mentioned that their partners believe in them or have urged them to take business risks or pursue job opportunities that were not immediately rewarding but led to longer- term satisfaction. They also look to their partners to be sounding boards and honest critics. One executive said that her partner asks “probing questions to chal - lenge my thinking so I can be better prepared for an opposing viewpoint. ” A partner’s support may come in many forms, but what it almost always boils down to is making sure the executive manages his or her own human capital effectively. The pressures and demands on execu - tives are intense, multidirectional, and unceasing. Partners can help them keep their eyes on what mat - ters, budget their time and energy, live healthfully, and make deliberate choices—sometimes tough ones—about work, travel, household management, and community involvement. Men, however, appear to be getting more spousal support overall. Male interviewees—many of whom have stay-at-home wives—often spoke of their spouses’ willingness to take care of children, tolerate long work hours, and even relocate, sometimes as a way of life. But by and large, they no longer seem to expect the classic 1950s “corporate wife, ” who hosted dinners for the boss and cocktail parties for clients. (Exceptions exist in some countries and industries. One male executive who works in oil fields said, “When you are living and working in those camp en - vironments, it is indispensable to have your wife talk with other spouses. ”) Men frequently noted that their partners won’t allow them to neglect their families, health, or social lives. For example: “My wife is mili - tant about family dinner, and I am home every night for dinner even if I have to work afterward. ” Women, by contrast, slightly more often men - tioned their partners’ willingness to free them from traditional roles at home.

When we look at the survey data, we see other striking differences between the sexes. Fully 88% of the men are married, compared with 70% of the women. And 60% of the men have spouses who don’t work full-time outside the home, compared with only 10% of the women. The men have an aver - age of 2.22 children; the women, 1.67. What Tomorrow’s Leaders Think The fact that the interviewees all agreed to take time from their hectic schedules to share their insights with students might introduce a selection effect. Busy leaders who choose to help students presum - ably value interpersonal relationships. Because they’re inclined to reflect on work and life, they’re probably also making deliberate choices in both Since 2008 more than 600 students in Harvard Business School’s second-year Managing Human Capital course have interviewed 3,850 C-suite executives and leaders (of whom 655 were CEOs, presidents, or board members) at companies and nonprofits around the world. THE GOAL? To gain greater insight into how today’s top leaders make choices in their professional and personal lives. This project has been a true partnership between the students and the executives. Everyone involved wanted to deeply explore what it means for leaders to manage their human capital in the 21st century—and more specifically, in the wake of the recent global recession. The executives were a diverse group (44% female, 56% male) and repre - sented a wide range of industries, including finance, retail, energy, health care, and technology. They came from 51 countries, and 45% of them had worked in countries other than the United States. The interviews were semistructured: As long as students related their ques - tions to topics covered in Managing Human Capital, they were allowed consid - erable leeway in what to ask and how far to go in following up on responses. That way they could dig into the issues they found most compelling. To supplement the interviews, we surveyed 82 senior executives who were attending a 2012 leadership course at HBS. We asked them about their experi - ences managing their careers",

All that may explain why many interviewees reported being basically happy despite their struggles and why few mentioned serious damage to their marriages or families due to career pressures. This sample is an elite group of people better positioned than most to achieve work/ life balance. That they nevertheless consider it an impossible task suggests a sobering reality for the rest of us. Our student interviewers say, almost universally, that the leaders they spoke with dispensed valuable advice about how to maintain both a career and a family. One interviewer reported, “All acknowl - edged making sacrifices and concessions at times but emphasized the important role that supportive spouses and families played. ” Still, many students are alarmed at how much leaders sacrifice at home and how little headway the business world has made in adapting to families’ needs. Male executives admitted that they don’t pri - oritize their families enough. And women are more likely than men to have forgone kids or marriage Students also resist leaders’ commonly held be - lief that you can’t compete in the global marketplace while leading a “balanced” life. When one executive argued that it’s impossible to have “a great family life, hobbies, and an amazing career” all at the same time, the student interviewing him initially thought, “That’s his perspective. ” But after more conversations with leaders? “Every single executive confirmed this view in one way or another, and I came to believe that it is the reality of today’s business world. ” It re - mains to be seen whether, and how, that reality can be changed for tomorrow. WE CAN’T PREDICT what the workplace or the family will look like later in this century, or how the two institutions will coexist. But we can assert three simple truths: Life happens.

As one pointed out, people tend to ignore work/life balance until “something is wrong. ” But that kind of disregard is a choice, and not a wise one. Since when do smart executives as - sume that everything will work out just fine? If that approach makes no sense in the boardroom or on the factory floor, it makes no sense in one’s personal life. There are multiple routes to success. Some people plan their careers in detail; others grab whatever opportunity presents itself. Some stick with one company, building political capital and a deep knowledge of the organization’s culture and resources; others change employers frequently, re - lying on external contacts and a fresh perspective to achieve success. Similarly, at home different so - lutions work for different individuals and families. Some executives have a stay-at-home partner; oth - ers make trade-offs to enable both partners to work. The questions of child care, international postings, and smartphones at the dinner table don’t have “right” answers. But the questions need to be asked. No one can do it alone. Of the many paths to success, none can be walked alone. A support net - work is crucial both at and outside work—and mem - bers of that network must get their needs met too. In pursuit of rich professional and personal lives, men and women will surely continue to face tough deci - sions about where to concentrate their efforts. Our research suggests that earnestly trying to focus is what will see them through.

So I haven’t had any negative career repercussions, but I’ve probably been judged personally. ” Executives of both sexes consider the tension between work and family to be primarily a women’s problem, and the students find that discouraging. “Given that leadership positions in corporations around the world are still dominated by men, ” one explained, “I fear that it will take many organizations much longer than it should to make accommoda",

They fail to defendthemselves against the competition, miss new markets, do not inno-vate effectively, can’t reach/retain their customers, and are unable tokeep their best people. Viewed from the outside, these corporate trainwrecks are troubling. Having been on the inside, I can tell you it’s worse than troubling;it’s excruciating. That’s because when you’re part of one of thesefailing efforts, it is personal: it’s your product that didn’t sell, it’s that new market opportunity you predicted but didn’t seize, it’s your missed results, your effort that was wasted. The executive team often complains that their teams “aren’t executing well.” The rest of theorganization grumbles that the execs “just don’t get it.” === Page 18 === Preface xviIn the end, what we often have is lost opportunity, lost human poten- tial, squandered corporate capabilities, and lost market value.Doesn’t that make you mad? It made me mad—mad enough to wantto fix it. I was fed up with my own behavior and that of my col-leagues. We were wasting our time, rather than focusing on the fun-damental problem: what is going to help us to win in the market. Weneeded to know how to set direction to win, and win repeatedly. What is the real issue we need to solve? The real issue is the system- atic way we go about setting direction and making tough trade-offs.For too long, the business world has insisted that major decisions beowned by only one part of an organization, the executive suite. Exe-cution and tactics are delegated to another part of the organization,those who actually get things done. If you’re within one of thesecompanies, you know what this leads to: an enormous gap betweenthe vision at the top and the understanding and alignment of those inthe organization that must turn that vision into a ground-level reality. In Silicon Valley, we call that gap an “Air Sandwich”: the empty void in an organization between the high-level strategy conjured up in the stratosphere and the realization of that vision down on the ground.Rather than connective pieces between the vision and the reality, thefilling in an Air Sandwich consists mainly of misunderstandings, confu-sion, and misalignment. This Air Sandwich prevents us from winning.This Air Sandwich is frustrating",

As soon as I could identify the Air Sandwich within the organization, I knew it was the very thing we needed to eliminate. But the AirSandwich is not the root cause of the problem. It is a symptom of theflawed legacy system of setting direction that may have worked agesago, but doesn’t any more. We need a new system. We need a prac-tical approach that demands that everyone be able to contribute, andlets us gather insights from anywhere in the organization. We needan approach that allows us to make decisions that align with thevision, collectively debate, and gather more reliable and insightfulinformation. We need an approach that helps us to use conflict andtension to motivate the creative process, identify the things thatmatter, and still drive alignment and resolution. And, given thenature of our times, we need an approach that lets us move faster, not slower, more practically than theoretically—and it sure better help ustap into the power of the people in our organizations. === Page 19 === Preface xviiMy team and I have developed—through years of discovery and synthesis, trial and error, some sweat, and a few tears—a differentapproach that gets everyone to collaborate and create winningstrategies. It has been used and tested, in whole or sometimes in part,on numerous real-world initiatives. This approach is the New How. I believe we can make smarter decisions and set direction faster andwith better information; that we can more effectively implement a direc-tion; that we can move swiftly as a whole organization with clarity ofpurpose; and that we can use the best of ourselves and one another todo business in a way that makes us proud. And if you’re reading this book, then you are not part of the “no way, no how” crowd. You’re ready for the “new way, new how.” The NewHow has helped bring more joy and more success to my experience ofbusiness. I hope it will do the same for you. So, let’s get started. === Page 21 === Introduction: Why Strategies Fail Failure is the opportunity to begin again, more intelligently. —Henry Ford Before We Fix It, Let’s Understand Why It Fails Watching a failed strategy rip through a company is akin to watching a powerful hurricane hit land and devastate everything in its path.Anyone who has witnessed such destruction hopes desperately tonever experience such a thing again.

I will tell you astory about my most dramtic experience of failed strategy. (Like allthe stories in this book, it is a true story, but some identifying detailshave been changed to respect confidentiality. The exception is “Profileof a Collaborative Leader” in Chapter 3, in which Hans Grande’s realname is used.) My role had a broad charter to work on product issues, sales com- pensation plans, marketing, and channel decisions—everythingabout setting and meeting revenue goals. It gave me a perfect van-tage point to watch the events unfold. Unfortunately, I wasn’t aninnocent bystander; I was complicit in what went down. It started innocently enough. My boss stopped by my office, excited, with big news: the company had decided to diversify our product linesix-fold within the coming 18 months. === Page 22 === Introduction 2The story she told had all the makings of a legend. The CEO had just shared the results of recent market exploration, which had con-vinced him that this strategic move would propel the company intothe future. After his inspiring talk, the CEO prompted the VPs to join the rallying cry. The way my boss described it, it was part revival and part cam-paign stump speech. Apparently, she was the first to volunteer. Shesaid she felt compelled to stand up and assert, “I think we need to dothis. Sign the Americas up!” Even though my boss hadn’t talked to anyone within her organiza- tion about what it would take to make this move a reality, she “justknew” it was the right idea to get us to the next level. Besides, shebelieved that if anyone in the company could figure out how to makethis happen, it would be us. After all, we had a stunning trackrecord—always delivered on our revenue, and the team was compe-tent and smart. I distinctly remember being impressed by the leader-ship my boss was exhibiting. The vision for this idea was a classic big, hairy, audacious goal. Not just a few products over two to three years, but six new product linesin 18 months. Sales and marketing would generate demand, withnew products developed in parallel. A move of this magnitude wouldtouch every facet of our company: revenue forecasts, individuals’roles, sales efforts, marketing initiatives, product roadmaps, cus-tomer expectations, and company reputation. Every part of the com-pany would need to be integrally involved",

I had concerns, but because I assumedeveryone understood the breadth of the impact on the company inthe same way I did, I didn’t voice them. After all, who wants to bethe one to question a direction, which would seem like tossing abucket of cold water on the company’s vision? So I kept quiet, figuring “the leaders” had it under control. Besides, like my boss, I believed in the team. Failure was not an option. OurCEO had said “we must,” and my boss said “we will.” With that inmind, the larger team and I charged forward with every intention todo our best and make good on the vision. A couple of months into the new revenue cycle, I got a call from a lead product manager who was responsible for the launch of our new === Page 23 === Introduction 3product suite. We often talked just to sync up or troubleshoot issues as they came up. This call, however, was different. The voice on theother end of the line was anxious and tense. There was no small talk.No sooner had I said “hello,” he jumped in and said: “We have a problem here. You know the lead product? Yeah, the one that’s supposed to net us most of this year’s revenue? We’re not going to be able to ship it with all the features we originally planned.” That spelled big trouble. If the new product was delayed, our rev- enue stream would collapse. Orders for our existing products werealready getting deferred because the new product direction had beenannounced. This one piece of news changed everything and set us onthe brink of a major sales stall. There was no question the situation was dire. My boss called a quick meeting with a few key people to ensure we could make decisionsquickly. Someone began by framing the facts of the situation to date,and then laid out three options, none of them appealing. We could: •Ship the product without the intended features, then face theanalyst and stock market repercussions. •Ship the product with all the features (even though they likelywouldn’t all work) and do a patch release later. •Delay the product for some undetermined amount of time untilwe could get it right. The conversation eroded into mayhem. Instead of a thoughtfuldebate concerning the trade-offs of each difficult option, the meetingquickly became a blame-fest for the Category-5",

The “discussion” included: “You are responsible for shipping the thing on time.” “Why did you commit to the deadline if you couldn’t make it?”“You were never supportive of this plan in the first place.”“You’re the sales manager. What’s stopping you from delivering revenues from our current product line?” Everyone in the room was smart and hardworking and absolutely certain that it could not be mewho was responsible for this mess. Accusations bred defensiveness, which in turn led to finger-pointing. === Page 24 === Introduction 4Just as quickly as we decided “we must,” it transformed to “we will,” then degenerated into “we can’t,” and we were left wondering “how?” As you can likely imagine, the team’s frustration rose, filling the room with anger and anxiety. Before the meeting disintegrated com-pletely, someone managed to get traction on the idea that we shouldsimply try to meet those commitments that were in our direct control.We ultimately agreed to ship the product on the original release date,knowing full well that it wouldn’t meet the customer expectations wehad previously set. It doesn’t take a crystal ball to figure out what happened next. There was no deus ex machina, no superhero swooping in to save the day. Nope. Revenues were weak. Several talented staff members resigned.The sales team was demoralized. The company was mired in theaftermath of key customers buying a product that didn’t work aspromised. The company eventually did manage to recover finan-cially, but the corporate culture took a nosedive. In response to thedebacle, people adopted cumbersome and complicated procedures tomake sure they didn’t get burned again. After taking massive riskswith little thought, people sought to avoid risk at all costs. Allaround, there was a high price to pay for such good intentions. So what went wrong? How did this well-intentioned new direction turn into such a trainwreck? And who was to blame? The answer is that none of us, and all of us, were at fault. Despite our best efforts, we were working with a strategy that was doomed fromthe start because of how it was formed. The market direction and vision of product diversification were solid, but the way that strategywas created itself lacked the deeper organizational engagement neces-sary to enable the company to achieve business success. Despite best efforts, some strategies are doomed from the start because of how they are formed. We had no process, framework, approach,",

And so we === Page 25 === Introduction 5didn’t internalize it; we simply took the direction as if that alone were enough. Without a way to consider cross-functional actions, envision different options and their necessary trade-offs, and make some tough choices early on, we missed the things that were essential toultimate success. In the absence of both group and individual accountability, it was easy to assume (as I did) that none of us was responsible for overallsuccess or for speaking up whenever something didn’t seem quiteright. Since there was no review of options by those who wouldimplement, none of us could recognize the risks of the new vision.Nor was there a way to discover all of the essential small tasks anddetailed work we had to complete. Not knowing this, we couldn’tmake trade-offs between functional groups. We didn’t know how toform a strategy that would become real. In short, we lacked a way tocollaboratively set direction to win. It was a perfect storm, a tsunami of a strategy failure. And I was left with the lingering questions: why did it happen? And is there anotherway? I came to learn that yes, there is. The failure had little, if anything, to do with the rightness of the big idea, and wasn’t really about the abilities of the individuals on ourteam. The genesis of the storm was the original formation of thestrategy itself. We went straight to execution. (As in, do not pass go, donot collect $200 million.) It’s tempting to view the strategy as correctand blame the execution, but that’s off base. A more accurate descrip-tion of the problem is that the strategy was incomplete. A fully developed strategy creation process would engage the team, identify the key interdependent tasks that must be done, find theweak spots and make changes, and get buy-in and accountability. Allthis needs to happen before execution. If we wait until execution, the measures and processes merely drive completion of items on achecklist, not overall clarity of purpose. When we recognize this, itbecomes obvious that the thinking and alignment are part of strategy creation. Some might argue that the execution began immediately inthis case because of the urgency, but that’s like firing a gun withoutlining up the sights first. It’s OK if you have a million bullets anddon’t mind a few misses. But if you",

At a glance, the ingredients aren’t any different from thoseof a strategy success: good intent + good direction or idea + talentedpeople + hard work + “magic black box.” We know there’s magicinvolved because sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t, andwe understand as much about the inner workings of that box as wedid the magician’s hat at our fifth birthday parties. We need toreplace the “magic black box” with a well-understood process frame-work, or a “New How” to do strategy creation. Different Types of Strategy Require Different Approaches After years of working with name-brand organizations and innova- tive startups, partnering to build successful strategies day in and dayout, I’ve come to realize that there is no shared definition of the word“strategy.” Not among exec teams, or boards of directors, or within asingle organization, and certainly not across organizations. Each of ususes it to mean something slightly different, and this lack of a shareddefinition can lead to misunderstandings. So, before we go any fur-ther, let me clear up what I mean when I use the word “strategy,”and in particular, what’s included in the scope of the definition as itrelates to this notion of collaborative strategy.Figure I-1 . Getting the strategy right takes time === Page 27 === Introduction 7Strategies are crucial to competitive organizations. Most people would agree on that, at least. And good strategies are essential towinning companies. So, simply put, a strategy is a way to win. Although it’s seemingly that simple on one level, practitioners knowthat strategy is also about making choices. It’s about deciding notonly what to do but what notto do. And it definitely involves making choices about who to involve, how to listen, which ideas to consider,and how to make tough decisions, as well as knowing what’s mostimportant and why. What’s not clear in that definition of strategy is scope, and that’s where confusion often sets in. My own experience and study suggest that strategy falls into two domains. The first (and more known) isthe kind of strategy that deals with where we compete, and the second is about how we compete (see Figure I-2).

Most often, the question the company aims to answer withinthis domain is which arena or market space they want to win—either in terms of which markets they want to own, or in terms of whatpositions they want in the larger market value chain. Strategic discus-sions like this typically take place more or less annually in boardroomsor executive suites. (Although I believe it can benefit the company to Figure I-2 . Types of strategy and their impacts === Page 28 === Introduction 8encourage good and diverse input on where we compete, the scope of who needs to be involved in making those decisions can be relativelysmall without affecting the success of that strategy.) A lot of energyhas already shaped this big bucket. Many, many great thinkers, par-ticularly Michael Porter, have shaped excellent frameworks on howbest to identify the right strategic domain. My intent isn’t to addmore to this field of work. Then there’s the lesser-known second domain: the how we compete strategy. In this case, strategy can be about day-to-day, quarter-to- quarter operations, as in: “What strategies would drive 50% growth inour consumer division?” or “What strategy is best to grow sales forProduct X?” In these cases, strategy defines the best ways for us to compete within an arena. This second domain of strategy, while not as “big picture,” has h-u-g-e impact for any organization, because this type of strategyis about determining the best way to win in the chosen space. It canaffect which regions, which products, which customer segments,which markets, which product lines, and so on. Once the businessdomain is set, defining where we want to compete, then nearly everyother big decision falls into the domain of “how best to compete.” Theeffectiveness of this bucket of strategic thinking determines whether theother (larger domain) strategy will turn out to be successful—or not. The kind of strategy in the “how to compete” domain is the answer to the question, “Given what we want, what is the best way toachieve it?” These are the kinds of strategies that can be created atalmost every level of an organization. The more complex and diversi-fied an organization is, the more its people need to excel at this kindof strategy creation. And most companies don’t know—not yet,anyway—how to do that kind of strategy creation in a way that getsthe best results. It is this",

The strategy of “how we compete” is not widely recognized as a formof strategy. Often this domain of strategy is regarded as “tactical” or“execution” or “details,” and so it is not addressed in any coherentway. Alternatively, people have treated the “how” as an extension ofthe “where,” and they try to apply the tools they already know fromDomain #1. Not good. “How we compete” is a domain of strategy === Page 29 === Introduction 9that requires its own set of tools, approaches, and frameworks. But they have a hammer, so it must be a nail, and therefore tools ofDomain #1 get brought over and used in Domain #2. This wrestling match over whether the “how” is strategic or tactical, strategy or execution, is actually an unnecessary and fruitless war.Our individual perspectives on the fight are shaped by our positionson the battlefield. From an executive’s viewpoint, the decisionsinvolved in how best to compete look tactical. But to general man-agers of multibillion-dollar businesses in support of the larger corpo-ration, their decisions don’t seem tactical. And, in my operating viewof the world, most “how best to compete” decisions are not tactical.These types of strategies shape and influence the success of the largercompany vision. One person’s strategy is another’s tactics. The unnecessary and fruitless war of what is tactics or strategy or execution must end. There is no question in my mind that the “how best to compete” includes both real strategic thinking and a number of tactical deci-sions. Reflecting back to the opening story, the choice of exactlywhen to announce the new product direction turned out to be a stra-tegic decision—but it was deemed tactical. Unfortunately, the perva-sive idea that the high-level “where” of strategy is all that matters leaves many strategies incomplete. By establishing and maintaining aculture that stuffs the “how” under “execution,” executives unwit-tingly create a stubborn, persistent structural gap within the organiza-tional entity—one that seriously undermines their ability to succeed. Perhaps people fixate on execution (“doing what’s required”) instead of finishing up strategy (“choosing the direction”) because it’s easierto see progress during execution than during strategy formation anddevelopment. And who would argue that strategy creation (in either domain) is not hard? Typically, new strategies get initiated first under some form ofstress or duress: you need to find a new market for revenue growth,your competition is",

In any suffi- ciently complex organization, it seems that there are millions ofthings competing in our “day jobs” as we also set direction for thefuture. Nothing slows down to make it easier to define and makechanges while running the existing business. Taken together, all of these tensions reinforce the organizational and cultural gap between strategy created at the top and executionassigned to the doers of the organization. The “How” Matters This gap exists for a reason. First, most people think of strategy as aplan, a vision, a direction, a thing. They consider that a strategy is thething that states something like, “Company X will enter the ABCmarket and own 30% share within five years.” In this way, strategy isa noun, and most of the time, it’s a complicated PowerPoint presen-tation or a dense three-ring binder filled with research findings andanalysis. For all the complexity of slides or density of binders, the“where we should compete” strategy usually can be articulated in asingle paragraph or slide. All the other dense information we create instrategy formulation of Domain #1 is background, or justification and“proof.” That is, all that other info helps the “thud” factor and addscredibility, but it rarely helps us take action and make that vision areality. Those dense wads often cannot and do not guide the execution. A strategic direction absolutely needs to be solid for a company to achieve success. But that’s notenough. Yet, it is often treated as if it were allthings “strategy” and everything else “execution.” Then all failure is blamed on execution. When strategy is conceived of as an answer, a noun, a thing, a tool, it’s easy to conclude that all that is needed is the right “thing/idea,”and then strong communication to help the organization understandit. That is, a strategy + a strong orator (or even a demagogue) willenable the organization to succeed. This is especially true when the === Page 31 === Introduction 11top executive team sees strategy simply as a vision for the overall organization, and doesn’t understand that the strategy creation pro-cess helps align the substrategies that must line up to support theorganizational vision and, ultimately, enable the change.

A strategy is not just a plan because,although the word “strategy” is by definition a noun (an artifact such asa document or presentation), in practice most people also use the wordto refer to the process by which the strategy is created. In other words,people overload the meaning of the word “strategy” because they don’tdistinguish the act of creating the way to win—strategizing—from one visible byproduct of the process. By missing this distinction, peopleare unable to see how much the process of developing the strategy isactually part of the strategy itself. Having a great strategic direction or idea with- out a prepared set of people who “get it” is effectively the same as having a bad idea. People and their organizations need both the noun/thing form of the strategy and the verb/process of strategy creation (see Figure I-3).You may have a wonderful strategy document, but if you begin exe-cution without engaging your team in strategy creation, you have agreat-looking PDF and an unprepared set of people. If you engage theteam, the PDF may have more typos but the content will be richer,plus there is the less-visible byproduct that your team will be wise,committed, and prepared. This nuance is key: if a strategy is, for ourpurposes, not complete until it has been put into action to create a newmarket reality, then the way you create strategy matters a great deal.

Strategy is the noun and needs a verb === Page 32 === Introduction 12When strategy is viewed as a noun and is not accompanied by a robust process framework to enable solid creation, we are left withsomething that simply won’t work. The thing—the noun—is brokenby the very way it was created. The Air Sandwich There’s a very specific perspective that leads to creating incomplete,ill-formed (aka “bad”) strategy. Strategy gets created incompletely mostly because strategy creation is perceived as an elite exercise, something that only an executive group ofpeople can and should do in a hotel ballroom with walls covered in flip-chart paper. This worldview becomes evident in a number of ways. One way in which strategy formation fails is when strategies are entirely set or approved by the executive team. The thinking is thatexecs are empowered to create strategy, so they hole up in long meet-ings, using models, complex frameworks, and vast amounts of vetteddata to decide things.

Another reason execs do strategy alone is that they want to drive alignment, and they believe that having something written down(“cast in stone”) is easier for VPs and managers to communicate con-sistently. Only a strong organization with a strong high-level visioncan tolerate an inclusive definition of the “how.” A weaker effort mayhave a partial, and therefore flawed, vision that will collapse underthe scrutiny of the “how.” Another way this worldview shows up is in the form of a mild plati- tude from an operational leader that sounds something like this: “Wedon’t want to bother you or distract you from your existing work, sowe made the strategic decisions for you and want you to validatethem in the next 45-minute session of our meeting.” Have you heardthings like this from the Powers That Be? If so, did it make you rollyour eyes (as soon as you were sure you wouldn’t be seen)? If you’rereading this book, you have an interest in creating successful strategy.You’re not looking to be a bystander in the game of strategy creation. === Page 33 === Introduction 13Those Powers That Be aren’t trying to do something wrong, but they lack a framework or process to do engaged strategy creation well, sothey don’t do it at all. Regardless of intent, these examples leave avoid in the business. This existing approach to strategy lacks depthand a connection to the realities of the business operations, theneeded debate of ideas that result in trade-off discussions, and theneed to align capabilities. It lacks a connection to the people who willmake that strategy a reality. And it creates an unnecessary separationbetween the decision of “where to win” and the “how” of winning. Top-down edicts also typically lack an understanding of organiza- tional capabilities and capacity, as well as an acknowledgment of whatthe people throughout the organization believe they canaccomplish. Obviously, this approach lacks collaboration, debates, discussions,and the necessary engagement of the organization. I’ve come to characterize this type of strategy creation as one that guarantees an “Air Sandwich.” This is where the company’s newdirection is delivered from an 80,000-foot perspective to the folksholding a 20,000-foot view, who in turn then try to coordinate thepeople working on the ground—producing a big “Air Sandwich” ofstrategy (see Figure I-4).

Strategy Air Sandwich === Page 34 === Introduction 14An Air Sandwich is, in effect, a strategy that has clear vision and future direction on the top layer, day-to-day action on the bottom,and virtually nothing in the middle—no meaty key decisions thatconnect the two layers, no rich chewy center filling to align the newdirection with new actions within the company. What is missing in the middle is the substance of the business— the debate of options, the understanding of capabilities, sharing of theunderlying assumptions, the identification of risks, issues that need to be tracked, and all the other things that need to be managed. Themiddle is missing a set of understandings that would connect the visionof the direction to the reality. By focusing only on the top or bottom, we lose the middle, which is where the value is. When a company has an Air Sandwich, the most valuable details and decisions that enable a strategy to succeed simply are left out of thestrategy creation process. And as a result, they are missing from theimplementation plans and the execution itself. In my earlier story, the strategy formation process was clearly incom- plete. If we had done it collaboratively, perhaps we could havechanged the direction to ship four products in 24 months—not ahuge shift but one that would have let the business achieve betterresults. For example, when an organization doesn’t test an idea to see whether it’s pragmatic or practical, the organization can unwittinglyset itself up for failure. This is the byproduct of assuming a given ideawill somehow just work. Or, when a critical underlying assumptionisn’t challenged or a risk isn’t highlighted, the people responsible forexecution cannot adjust their resource requirements, operatingmodels, or business practices. These disconnects have both directand indirect costs to the organization (Table I-1). Chances are, youcould add a couple of items of your own to this table. And for thisreason, we need to find a way to change how strategy is created. === Page 35 === Introduction 15An Air Sandwich may be filled with nothing, but taking a big bite of one can certainly leave a bad taste in your mouth. Some executiveswho’ve sampled an Air Sandwich in the past will attempt to preventthem in the future by managing at a level of detail that underminesthe organization’s leverage, power, and influence. For example, oneapproach is to circumvent future implementation issues by deliv-ering top-line visions in an almost",

Disconnects and costs of the traditional approach DISCONNECT COST Data is gathered, but the people with the most insight about the relevanceand meaning of that data are not con-sulted in the interpretation process.Decision makers do not have the con-text to understand the situation clearlyand correctly, and therefore they fix thewrong problem or create impracticalapproaches. Ideas are generated by a few, but notvetted for organizational implications.Creates impractical approaches. Plus,the missed opportunity of gathering per-haps more useful ideas. An understanding of which practicalsteps will support the strategy does notexist throughout the organization.Different functional groups take differentapproaches, leading to conflict, frustra-tion, and malaise. Creates an organiza-tion of disempowered people. A misunderstanding between what thetop-level executives see in their organi-zation’s future and what the people onthe ground know about the capabilitiesor capacity of the organization.Bad decisions are made in the middlelevels, causing a diffusion of resources.Money is wasted; time is lost. Employ-ees are alienated. Customers defect. A commitment to a common cause mayexist at the top, but isn’t spread in atangible way through the organization.Tension over issues that appear to beabout “wrong people” but often is fric-tion caused by lack of clarity or commit-ment to the strategy. === Page 36 === Introduction 16Sounds good, right? Sad to say, it rarely works. Directives like this aim to make it easier to implement a strategy, but this technique ofspelling out the ways and means to accomplish a strategic goal is gen-erally a setup for failure. In cases like this, here’s what often hap-pens: the exec team decides not only the goal or direction, as in“Grow X product in the government space,” but they have tacked onthe specific way to do it, “by lowering price.” Again, sounds good. But here’s the rub: what if price isn’t the root cause? Say that the group of people driving government sales at the20,000-foot level knows for a fact that price is not the issue. Then,essentially, this detailed provisioning of direction becomes a furtherbarrier to success. The problem here is that the vision itself may be directionally correct, but the details of the",

Grow product sales in the government space or lower theprice? Release the product on schedule as currently designed, ordelay the launch until the new features are included? Build a viralvideo or create something that customers will notice? Should wechoose the rock or the hard place? When the top exec’s strategy doesn’t jive with what employees know to be true, questions stream continuously through people’s minds asinternal dialogue: “Is it just me, or is there a fatal flaw in this strategy?”…“Am I sup- posed to say something?”…“Will I get in trouble if I say some- thing?”…“Will I get in trouble if I don’t say something?”…“If I talkabout my concerns, will I be perceived as a troublemaker?”…“If Ican’t see how I can make this happen, will I be told I’m being tootactical?”…“Will I have to pay a price somewhere down the line if Ilook like I’m not on board with this plan?” Questions such as “Should I say something?” or “Do they care about my opinion?” are whispered between coworkers when the organiza-tion lacks the tools for involving people and supporting collabora-tion in the strategy creation process (Figure I-5). These kinds of unasked questions are a sure sign that a strategy is headed down the path toward failure, because they signal that the === Page 37 === Introduction 17strategy wasn’t created properly or vetted deeply enough in the orga- nization to be executed well. Offering detailed directives causes special trouble in high change sit- uations, where dynamics in the marketplace cause things to shiftquickly. In cases like these, by the time the strategy trickles downthrough the organizational structure and multiple levels of decisionmaking, the market opportunity may have long disappeared. Most people become aware of an Air Sandwich in the organization only after the proverbial shit has hit the fan. Messy. The New How: Let ’Em Think The shape and force of outside market pressures will surely impact howa company works to respond. Inside the walls of corporations today,the pressure to continuously improve is relentless. The world of central-ized organizations, multi-year product cycles, and one-way communica-tion to our customers and markets is fading fast.

The missing questions matter === Page 38 === Introduction 18The way strategy creation takes place inside organizations is the key to being able to respond rapidly and fluidly as a whole organiza-tion to what’s happening in your marketplace. Winning depends on fully completed strategy now more than ever before. What leaders at all levels are expected to do today comparedto even 10 years ago is amazingly demanding. More and better cre-ative strategies are needed to win, and the rapidly shifting market hasrobbed us of the luxury we once had to ready, aim, fire. Now, it feelsmore like fire, fire, fire. This situation is highly demanding of peoplein a number of ways—begging that they consciously improve theirstrategy for setting strategy. There are two ways in which I think about strategy: first, as an orga- nization’s plan for the future, and second, as the act of creating thatplan. In short, how you decide is now as important as what youdecide. I’ve come to see that the model, framework, theory, orPowerPoint you devise (which is typically how strategy is repre-sented) matters as much as the less-observed set of deliberations, dis-cussions, and understandings that happen amongst people who ask“Can we?” and “Should we?” and “When will we?” It is when theteam has these discussions and comes together to say, “Yes, wewill…” that an entire organization becomes aligned and can actuallygo and make the strategy manifest. The key area for improvement isto stop focusing entirely on the PowerPoint, and step up efforts toengage the people. A good friend of mine works for John Chambers,CEO of Cisco Systems, who recently shared the changes he is makingto lead in this new business climate: I was always a command-and-control type. If I said “turn right,” all 65,000 employees turned right. But it’s not possible for an organization to scale and take on more when only one person is driving all of the strategy. When you’re a command-and-control CEO, individuals impacted by your decision can choosenot to buy in, and either slow or even stop the process. This is espe-cially dangerous [in] an industry that moves as fast as this one. In my view, the days of being vertically integrated and having every- thing within your control will never return. The entire leadershipteam, including me, had to invent a different way to",

When I first got to a meeting,I’d listen for about 10 minutes while the team discussed a problem. === Page 39 === Introduction 19I knew what the answer was, and eventually I’d say, “all right, here’s what we’re going to do.” But, when I learned to let go and give the team time to come to the right conclusion, I found they made just as good decisions or evenbetter, and just as important, they were more invested in the decisionand thus executed it with greater speed and commitment. I had tolearn to have the patience to let the group think. 1 That’s a powerful message. His traditional ways of doing strategy that were successful in the past won’t work in the future. It’s time totake notice. The lesson we can learn from Chambers is that no matterwho we are, the way we work and specifically the way we do strategycreation need to be reinvented. We need to let people think and create strategy everywhere. This applies to companies large and small. Smaller companies might find this naturally easier because of theirfocus, but larger firms have more to gain because of the natural com-plexity of many businesses, people, directions. Companies that learnto harness the value of decentralized power will win against thosethat simply exploit their people to perform specific tasks. Chambers’s words are a call to action for finding ways to let entire organizations think and create, so that what’s created is done betterand faster, and is aligned to the larger whole. Chambers tells us thatthe new approach must share decision-making power, encouragevaluable debate, and let the reasoning of “why” something is good beclear and open. His words suggest that we move from leaders telling and doers doing toward each of us discerning, thinking, and acting. We’ll move fromvertical strategy creation (top-down telling) to horizontal strategycreation (where we are all share ownership). Surely, We Can Do This Important Thing Better Strategies fail for a number of reasons. Some are legitimate reasons,such as the competition created a better offer or a disruptive oppor-tunity changed the landscape. But there are also pointless reasonswhy strategies fail—ones that we can change by changing how we dostrategy creation. === Page 40 === Introduction 20Many strategy failures are avoidable.

Companies using traditional top-down strategy creation models seem to be going slower and slower. At the same time, the volume and com-plexity of strategic decisions happening today are increasing. Thesechanging conditions demand a model for thinking about strategy cre-ation and a process framework to guide our thoughts and actions. Without a way to think about and align strategic decisions, the strat- egies are doomed to fail. We need a new approach to winning that isnot dictated from the highest levels of an organization. Inside themost innovative companies, strategic decisions happen at multiplelevels within the organizations. For our businesses to thrive and drivethe kind of innovation and growth that our economy needs, we needgood strategy creation capabilities throughout our organizations. We can build a community of people who think about strategy cre- ation not as a set of artifacts, but as a powerful process. Then,together, we can redefine ourselves in how we create value. We canembed collaboration into the system as part of both our thinking andour doing. When we add the talents, perspectives, abilities, anddesires of the organization into the process, we can make strategy cre-ation an ongoing process of creative collaboration. Let’s move forward and focus on a more predictable and consistent approach to strategy creation: one that combines strategy and execu-tion, engages people in collaboration, and takes into account the essen-tial conditions that are necessary for well-formed strategies to happen. The first step is to recognize the structural barriers that drive faulty pro- cesses. Let go of the idea that when strategy fails, someone—a humanbeing—must be at fault, and not the established system itself. We’resmarter than that! Consider the faulty assumptions and rules and theresulting processes. The very way we go about creating strategy deter-mines a big share of its success downstream. To fix the outcome ofstrategy, we need to look at the total system that produces strategy.That’s next. === Page 41 === Chapter 1CHAPTER 1 System Overload If you can smile when things go wrong, you have someone in mind to blame. —Unknown It’s not enough to rage against the lie.

Someone must have madethe wrong decision, failed to do the right thing, or both. “If only we’d had the right people on the bus, we would have succeeded,” is what wesay. The mental betting pools begin on who will wind up getting tossedunder that very same bus. Most often, there’s some good reason for blaming people. After all, mistakes were made. “Any fool could have seen that our suppliercouldn’t ramp production that fast.” “Engineering missed their com-mitted date. Simple as that.” Or “Listen: They’ve walked before, andthey’ve chewed gum before. All they had to do was walk and chewgum at the same time!” Well, maybe. Who is at fault is not simply anobjective question; it is often a political necessity. So we play “he === Page 42 === Chapter 1 22said, she said,” pick a scapegoat for the failure, and move on. But is this useful? That is, will blaming people help any of our businesses tobe successful the next time? People aren’t the core reason why strategies fail. Of course they are part of the dynamic, but we often look to blame people as if that’s the whole story. If only it were that simple. When failures happen, Ihave seen that there are persistent, telltale patterns. As I visit Com-pany A in the morning, Company B in the afternoon, and CompanyClater that same day, day after day for 10 years, I see that the fail-ures are not simply isolated human missteps that can be avoided inthe future by replacing one or two individuals. Instead, the issues aresubtle variations of systemic problems. Some problems are dominantin one set of companies, and others are dominant in other firms, butthe same few crop up over and over. This is great news, because inthe failures we can study the systemic issues, understand them, andcreate a New How to go forward. Three situations illustrate the systemic problems. All are byproducts of the Air Sandwich we covered in the introduction, where the top ofthe organization issues orders at the 80,000-foot level and lobs them down to the folks at the 20,000-foot level, without the benefit of feed- back, questions, or even a reality check from below.

The Three Systemic Patterns The first situation involves limited participation, the second is about thefocus on speed, and the third relates to unresolved questions. “Tunnel Vision” Quick, smart, and hard working, Sue was passed over for promotionafter promotion, despite good reviews. While personally frustrated atthe lack of advancement, she didn’t walk away like so many otherswould have. She wanted to work with these people and thisproduct set. She didn’t just like the company; she loved it. So, she keptaiming to do even better and crack the secret code. One day, she === Page 43 === System Overload 23finally got the insight on why she was passed over for the most senior echelon of leadership. Her boss’s boss shared, “You get involved anddrive the things you are specifically chartered to solve, but you don’tjump into stuff outside your domain.” Sue was a great leader within her own discipline, but was not viewed as a company leader. Now, we could say that Sue just wasn’t that good. We could say it’s an isolated incident involving one person and her individual situation. Butof course that’s not the whole story. Sue’s story highlights a pattern oflimited participation and holding back that pervaded the company. Thecompany kept bringing in outsiders as the next echelon of leaders ratherthan promoting from inside. I knew of other mid-level leaders at thisfirm who were getting similar feedback from different managers. Eachleader shared with me why they behaved as they did, and it came downto this: they hesitated to move beyond their specific assignments, out offear of treading on others’ toes. You see, this firm’s culture valued “get-ting along.” The systemic problem was that the culture norm con-strained each individual to stay within unspoken, invisible lines ofbehavior. “Working together to solve the problem” was ranked lowerthan “getting along.” The essential environment for supportive collabo-rative actions and behaviors was not yet in place. Remarkably, the executive, Sue, was able to treat her insightful con- versation as a springboard to change how the company worked. Sheused it to set the stage for stepping outside her own domain of exper-tise and engage with colleagues to drive increased collaborationacross boundaries, while the senior execs saw the broader issue andchanged the company culture so it was safe for Sue and others to act.

That means companies must work acrossboundaries and silos to create new things and build greater speed forthe company as a whole. The more complex the organization, themore cross-silo collaboration is needed. When members of the orga-nization keep to their isolated sandbox, it leaves holes in the largertapestry. So firms must seek to avoid the pattern of discouraging pro-ductive cross-discipline contribution. === Page 44 === Chapter 1 24“Ahead of Yourself” The second costly pattern involves a focus on the doing without shared thinking. Ian, a general manager chartered to grow “the next big thing” for his division, was entrepreneurial and gung-ho. Working with him and a small group of people in the division, mycompany had identified a brand-new market where buyers had a“latent need”: a deep source of pain they would pay money to solve,but that no offering could solve today. The idea, the competitivelandscape, and the size of that market opportunity ($2 billion) werewell vetted. The board of the company gave the green light to activelypursue this new market. So far, so good. That’s when things got off track, and perhaps you’ll see a bit of your own organization in this next part. With “the big idea” approved, Ianbrought together his broader management team and all the extendedmembers of the organization responsible for execution. He sharedthe results of the board discussion with all the “doers”: people frommarketing, engineering, delivery, and so on. He finished the update,took a few questions, and then moved on to the next steps. Withthinly veiled impatience, he emphasized, “Let’s get going!” Oneperson, dialed in via conference call, raised the key question: “Getgoing how?” Unseen by the questioner, the look on the GM’s faceleft no doubt of his low regard for the person. You probably knowthe look. Intentional or not, it says, “I get it, so why don’t you? Whatare you, s-l-o-w?” Others present, not wanting to be seen as obstruc-tionist, bit their tongues and got focused on “let’s get going.” And so it went. Ian effectively said, “Charge up that hill!” (Figure 1-1) and everyone attempted to do so. The team spent sixmonths trying desperately to make the new market materialize, butgot nowhere. People exhausted themselves trying to make it happen,but time and again, something was always amiss, and the executionfailed. Ian made the mistake of assuming that what was obvious",

By going straight toexecution without sorting out dependencies and risks, andexplaining why certain things needed to happen, Ian failed to align his team. So everyone raced off at top speed with no coordination,looking like a tribute to the movie Keystone Kops. You already know where this story ends, right? Failure. After six months of zero === Page 45 === System Overload 25progress, formerly committed teammates began taking other jobs. Ian was moved to another role. That particular “hill” was never seized,and a lot of business opportunity was lost. Everyone—team mem-bers, Ian, execs—was frustrated, though not all in the same way. Of course, wanting to move fast and get a-going toward a plum of an opportunity is not a bad thing! Speed absolutely matters. Butthere are devils in those details that enable people to go fast, in the rightdirection, together! When people don’t understand what is reallyneeded, they can’t make key decisions that align with all the otherplayers. Try as they might, they each end up going in slightly differentdirections. Ian’s 80,000-foot take was that what needed to happennext was “clear,” and he wanted people to get into gear and go, go, go. Ian did not just forget to ask for thinking—he squashed the verynotion. Strategic thinking, including things like understanding all thatwould need to change, deliberating options, making tough choicesbetween those options, and nailing down who owns what respon-sibilities, does not happen in spite of a process. It needs to be driven bythe process. Ultimately, it is effective collaborative thinking that completes the “how” of strategy and drives the speed of execution. You can align people by the very way that strategy is created. Thethinking and “why” of what matters gets encoded into the organiza-tional ethos, the building blocks of every future action. That’s whenFigure 1-1. Leaders can send the wrong signals === Page 46 === Chapter 1 26you can outpace the competition.

To accomplish this big strategic shift, a lot of things at the company neededto change, from the kinds of products they built to how they built them.Their goals required getting many external software developers involvedand committed to this new platform, which meant that they no longerhad 100% control of their own destiny. On many levels, it would take anew approach to doing business for them to succeed. There was no one owner of this shift; it involved everyone at Livery, so everyone had to own a part of the larger strategy. When a significantproblem arose, no single party could solve it, because it affected five dif-ferent leaders and their divisional responsibilities. One leader opted toresearch the issue, to find its root cause and make recommendations forhow to move forward. So far, so good: there was a problem, andsomeone took responsibility for it. But when this leader came back withrecommendations to share with his peers, do you know what he heard? Rather than a meaty discussion on how to apply the recommenda- tions, what he got instead was pushback. “We’ve known that forsome time,” “how will we know for sure” that the recommended solu-tions would work, and “we’ve tried that before” were the gist of theconversation. The responses guaranteed that many questions would gounresolved. Zero progress was made. All agreed they needed to solvethe problem, but the comfortable focus on things-already-known cutshort the rather messy but necessary forward-looking conversation.The five leaders were struggling with learning about the unknown andhow to drive change. Each leader had well-defined individual goals,which did not add up to success. The gaps in between their roles were not owned and thus compromised the business outcome. Because allof them owned it, no one owned it. They were the right people withthe perspective and judgment to make the decision, but they were not === Page 47 === System Overload 27comfortable with it. They did not want to bear the risk of the decision, and had other work nagging them for attention. And so, despite clearevidence of a problem and some consensus that the problem was intheir neighborhood, the leaders did nothing. There was a side effect as well. When the leaders show that they’re reluctant to tackle change, other people in the organization whostart out eager to initiate change and drive new solutions get stuck.“Why bother? It’s above my pay grade.” They go back to theirdefined job",

Everyone is exasper- ated at the lack of progress. The leaders can’t see how their subtle insis-tence on certainty and clear, definitive answers for a new businessproblem actually stall progress. That risk-averse demand for certaintyundermines the collaborative problem solving and tough choicesneeded to enable business success. Why does it matter who in an organization handles unresolved ques- tions? Many companies would just let festering issues bubble up to thetop echelon of the leadership, but that slows company progress. Andbesides, does the very top of a complex organization really have theright context to make most calls? Organizations benefit when thepeople nearest the issue figure out how to solve it. Luckily, when the CEO drove a new way of working, Livery was able to figure outnew ways the organization could make decisions closer to the pointof action. Some people left because it was so different than theircommand-and-control way of working, but the overall sense ofresponsibility within the organization grew, and with it their abilityto compete in the marketplace. The Telltale Signs Although it would be easy to look at these stories as isolated situa-tional flaws, they are really common systemic issues companies face.They are evidence of how many firms are systemically set up to fail atstrategy creation. While many people say they value collaboration,their people, processes, and organizational systems are not set up tosupport it. Each story highlights a particular element that wasmissing from the strategy creation process, namely: === Page 48 === Chapter 1 28•The collaborative actions and attitudes that encourage people to step up and shape the organization’s future together. •A way to work through the energy-consuming and often untidyprocess of shared strategy creation that reaches beyond the bigidea, while still arriving at an end destination in a timely manner. •The organizational ability to share ownership, do shared problemsolving, and make decisions nearest the source of the problem,enabling the whole organization to go fast and stay aligned. To transform how companies set direction and achieve results, it’simportant to understand and tune (or in some cases, reinvent) the waywe enable people to create, communicate, make decisions, work collab-oratively, and take action. To support straightforward examination, ithelps to translate these stories into specific warning signs that we canlook for in our organizations.

The telltale signs PARTICIPATION AND OWNERSHIP Signs Lesson for collaborative strategy •Pay attention to who is invited and encouraged to be involved in thestrategy creation process. Is it just theelite part of the organization, or is abroad range of people involved? Canthe people involved bring different andbroad points of view to the table?Once there, is there a demand thatthey step up and participate? •Look at how facts are gathered. Are thepeople who live in that domaininvolved? Are many voices encouragedto participate and have a point ofview? Do leaders say, “I’d like toinvolve the team, but they’ll just slowus down”? If so, the process is biasedtoward seeking agreement or meetinga preset timeline, rather thandiscovery, ownership, and getting tothe right answer. •If individuals say, “It’s not my call,”then you have a lack of collaborativerewards. •Watch how leaders react when individ-uals make suggestions or ask probingquestions. If they routinely and consis-tently say, “We’ve already consideredthat” or “Let’s take that offline,” thenthe larger organization is not valued.•Inclusive participation with the expec-tation that “everyone whose jobincludes judgment and choice mustown the solution” is quite differentfrom organizations seeking low involve-ment, or excluding players, or seeingstrategy as owned by the top of theorganization. •When the strategy process is exclu-sionary, important viewpoints,perspectives, and data get missed,diminishing the effectiveness of yourstrategy and hampering alignment andexecution.

DISTRIBUTED DECISION MAKING Signs Lesson for collaborative strategy •If you notice that the focus of thestrategy creation process is solely onfacts, assertions, and what is alreadyknown, your process is in trouble. •Do you hear statements like thefollowing: “This idea is missing x, y,and z,” “We can’t prove this will work,”and “We’ve tried this before.” Thesestatements are used to shut downinquiry and avoid making new but harddecisions. •Look for where problem solving takesplace.

Even with well-defined outputs and things moving quickly,the business can go south because the right debates, discussions, anddecisions have not yet happened.

Let’s look at how to set up a successfulstrategy creation system. Strategy in the Organizational System For a strategy creation process to engage people and still work opti-mally, a host of organizational elements need to come together. Weaim to create an environment that supports people working togetherin the dynamic tension that enables generating excellent ideas, chal-lenging underlying assumptions, vetting those ideas, sharing owner-ship, gaining a deep understanding, and establishing accountabilityfor success. What follows will paint the full picture of how organiza-tions can come together to form strategy. First, even bright, talented, and motivated people cannot jointly create effective strategies—ones that people can implement to produce greatresults—until the fundamental enablers of collaboration are in place. Ifresponsibility-sharing, decision-making, or idea-generation protocols donot enable a co-creative and collaborative approach, individuals can’tovercome the obstacles to success. The fundamental organizationalenablers for collaborative strategy fall into three areas (Figure 1-3): Individual behaviors and attitudes How do people act individually and within groups in the company? Strategic process Is there a structure or method that helps people learn the problem, create options, make tough choices, and create accountability whilesetting direction? === Page 52 === Chapter 1 32Organizational principles Where are decisions made within the company, what is rewarded, how are goals set, and how are disputes resolved solearning happens? Of course, all three parts of the individual behaviors, strategic process,and organizational principles are tied to the organizational system. Byestablishing a set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices foryour organization or team, you’ll establish a system of collaborative,productive work. Let’s explore each of these elements and how theyultimately come together to help you and your organization establisheffective strategy and reach new results. Individual Behaviors and Attitudes in Collaborative Strategy As we all know, simply telling people what needs to be done is rarely enough to produce action. Yet that’s exactly what many organiza-tions often do in the strategy process. Creating excellent strategydepends on collaboration throughout the organization. This book will explain in detail a new holistic approach for aligning people to a direction by involving them in fully defining the “what”(the idea) and the “how” (developing options for how to deliver onthe idea) and helping them all to understand the “why” (the reasonswhy something matters). When the what/how/why come together,then people come to own it. They believe in what they are doing.Figure 1-3. Systemic elements of",

They know how to react afew weeks down the road when some change threatens to knockthings askew. We call this new approach the New How. This has specific implications. For collaborative strategy creation to work, we need to have a way for many people, regardless of title orrank, to participate in setting direction. And we also need theirideas to be valued and their contributions respected. Good strate-gies require great new ideas that can come from anyone and areoften not a product of any single individual. Getting at the valuableideas that are embedded in your team requires sharing ownership ofsuccess within the organization. The act of recognizing ideas basedon their merit, not just based on who proposed them, gives somecredit and recognition to the individuals or teams behind these ideas.Doing this well moves the focus to the ideas and shared ownership.As will become clear, it is important to be able to build up, teardown, and reconstruct ideas. It’s best if individuals don’t get tootightly bound to their ideas, or they may perceive criticisms of theideas as personal attacks. Also, we want the full team to be comfort-able adding to the ideas. So we seek shared ownership of ideas, andranking of ideas based on their merit. We call this dynamic a “meri-tocracy of ideas.” Quite often, this means that people don’t need to have fully formed recommendations before arriving at the table, but instead bring theirthinking ability. Thinking happens “in the moment,” and so oftenthe individual nuggets and partial ideas are not airtight. Rather thancriticizing and discarding incomplete ideas, leaders will build uponthe useful pieces and encourage the shaping of options through aniterative process. The sources of individual ideas can see how theircontributions were carried forward, which allows them to buy intothe resulting strategy. It sounds good to have a meritocracy of ideas, but it also raises the stakes for all the people involved. It means that people in the organi-zation share a responsibility to play an active role, where they take personal responsibility for what gets created. When people areinvited to participate, they need to be fully present with their pointsof view and willing to engage in setting direction. That means put-ting aside egos and politics and to stop attending meetings as === Page 54 ===",

Rather, the expectation on each of us is to show up as full participants in discovery and creation.It is easier said than done. Later, when the decision is made, each of us knows we’ve been heard and feels as though the decision is, in a real sense, ourdecision. When that’s true, we support the call that ultimately gets made. Whether people choose to fully engage is deeply influenced by the behaviors and attitudes of the company’s leaders. So we’ll definewhat behaviors and attitudes are needed to enable productivecollaboration. But people’s behaviors are not enough to enable a collaborative envi- ronment. We also need to set up work processes that enable peopleto come together. Process for Collaborative Strategy The strategy gap represented by the organizational Air Sandwich willnot be filled with more presentations from above. PowerPoint slidesare just another form of air in the sandwich. What’s missing from theAir Sandwich isn’t repetition of high-level ideas, it’s practical under- standing. Getting more people involved in the process leads to twobenefits. First, it increases the diversity of perspectives, which meansmore potential ideas that win and more potential pitfalls avoidedearly. And second, it means decisions aren’t simply directives fromabove. By having two-way communication about the strategy as it isformed, follow-on decisions can be made faster and better becausethe people making those decisions understand the intent behind thestrategy, and why X must be done and Y must not be done, and howto choose between W and Z when those decisions arise. This letsmanagement push the decision-making process closer to execution,supporting much faster action and helping to ensure that the cascadeof decisions align with one another. To accomplish this, however, we need to go slow to go fast. We need to involve the right people, do the necessary drill-down, and flesh outthe feasibility details so it will work. Unlike what Ian believed wasright, people need to create the “how” of strategy. But the processcannot take forever. We need to limit it. We need a process that sup-ports participatory investigation, yet converges in a practical amount === Page 55 === System Overload 35of time and generates a concise and specific set of actions. Our strategy creation process, and the mindset of the people driving it,must meet several key criteria to ensure both understanding andquick closure: •The process and mindset must ensure a shared understandingof the current context.

Big problems mustbe deconstructed so they can be tackled by your organization.Some organizations try to take on the biggest problems all at thesame time—what I call eating an elephant in one sitting (Figure 1-4). These organizations don’t really know their limits,and they don’t know what’s involved in their tasks. They take ontasks that are too large, and consequently they fail. •The process must help translate the inherent tensions of a prob-lem into constructive, creative energy. When debate and brain-storming are welcomed, people can both contribute and processnew data, insights, and perspectives. Without debate, issues willnot be surfaced, and people will find it difficult to aim toward theright target. Organizations that squash debate typically “jump theFigure 1-4. Eating the whole elephant at once = recipe for disaster === Page 56 === Chapter 1 36gun” by getting started on problem solving without first fully understanding the root cause of a problem. •The process should include mechanisms to identify and resolveconflict. Organizations often struggle with collaboration when thetime comes to converge on a unified strategy. Many people areinvolved, and every idea in the pool seems to be someone’sfavorite. Teams tend to overinvest in trying to keep every ideaalive. 1For collaboration to work, the process must provide a way to cull the best ideas from all the options. We need to know howto spray weed-killer on some ideas and put fertilizer on others. With an effective shared process in place, organizations can finallydo the necessary discovery, debate, and elimination of ideas so theycan lead the march toward progress and, in the end, success.Included in the New How is a specific yet flexible and convergentprocess framework. But no process can take hold if the organization doesn’t have rules and principles in place to ensure that people cooperate and align with oneanother. That’s a crucial part of a collaborative strategy process. Organizational Principles for Collaborative Strategy The notion of harnessing the untapped talent, ideas, and insights of your people and their ideas isn’t new. But collaboration in action is rare because there is trickiness to it. It requires a mindset and a well-tuned process, and they need to mesh.It’s very hard to add collaboration to an existing organization. Thereis a kind of quandary, the business strategy version of a",

But occasion-ally a large and successful organization will not follow that faulty logic,like Tiger Woods choosing to optimize his swing. John Chambers hastold us that Cisco, the dominant firm in networking, is turning thebattleship by institutionalizing collaboration. 2 Organizational rules of engagement can present pernicious problems fordoing strategy collaboratively. This is because, in part, these rules are === Page 57 === System Overload 37about invisible structures and abstract systems that are embedded in the fabric of the organization. The ownership of these rules feelsanonymous. If these rules create motivations at odds with collabora-tion, then nascent efforts to encourage teamwork can be doomed.And so these rules must be examined closely. The New How identifiesfour principles for defining rules that enable organizations to collabo-rate effectively: they involve driving decisions locally, setting upincentives that reward common success, defining common goals,and making learning a key function of the organization. One thing that helps organizations to collaborate is to view strategy creation less as a rigid turn-the-crank effort and more as a pathway todiscovery. This highlights the “how” of strategy, what I refer tosimply as “strategizing.” Strategizing organizations view strategy asboth a noun and a verb. The team members are constantly alert forways to enhance success, knowing that some ideas will get inte-grated into execution quickly, and others will be pocketed until thetime is right. Organizations collaborate best when the rewards are based more on organizational success and less on individual accomplishment. Simi-larly, collaboration works when the results are measured, progress istracked, and people stay in touch with what is going on. Withouttracking, you get poor coordination, weak feedback, and weakaccountability. Commitment and momentum will fade. You’ll seethat the organizational principles provide the glue that connects thepeople and processes into an organization-wide ability to win. Naming the Systemic Issues Lets Us Fix Them In light of all these ideas, can you look back at a strategy creationprocess you have been involved in—perhaps one where it didn’twork out well—and see systemic patterns of weakness? Perhaps youhad an experience, like the one I shared in this book’s introduction,where you had an inkling that things weren’t quite right. There arealways early warning signs, but they can be hard to make sense ofwithout a frame of reference. And even if you see them, addressingthem is",

People are just one of the core elements that influence the dynamic of strategy creation, yetthey’re typically the prime targets when a strategy goes belly up.Blaming strategy breakdowns on individuals gives management thesense that they have fixed something. But when strategy is created inan impaired system, swapping out people doesn’t fix much. Good strategy creation depends on both a good system and good people. If you have a talented team and assemble the right systemicelements—individual behaviors and attitudes, processes, and organi-zational principles—you have the makings of a powerful organizationfor creating strategy. The rest of this book is organized into three partsaimed at addressing the systemic components. Part I describes how people need to “be” in the system, both as indi- viduals and as leaders. How we engage with one another matters agreat deal, because people generate the ideas and make the decisionsthat determine what value we create together. How we behave towardone another is inseparable from how we work together. Part II focuses on the methodology for doing collaborative strategy. Setting direction is an art and a practice. We need to know when andhow to open up the spigot of ideas, and when to close the spigot andaccomplish something. Collaborative planning and decision makinghas a bad rap, somewhat deserved, for never “getting there.” Byintroducing a solid yet flexible process framework, you can be bothcollaborative and fast. Part II also includes the chapter on theMurderBoarding process, which is the basis of the strategy selectionmethod. Readers interested in narrowing options may read Chapter 6on its own. Part III takes us up a level to think about the rules of engagement that organizations can put in place to foster a culture of collabora-tion and successful strategy outcomes. Changing organizational cul-ture requires more than just bold moves and big announcements.How do you get whole groups of people to alter the way they think,work, and act? To help a new culture stick, you need a small numberof big changes, and thousands of supporting small acts.

Closing the gap for the Air Sandwich starts with fixinghow we collectively work together. That means we need to explore andname the ways by which people can act to encourage collaboration. There’s a saying: “It’s not personal; it’s business.” Any of you believe that? Of course not! Because what that quote actuallyimplies is that when we are doing work, how we interact with oneanother is irrelevant. Surely by now you already know I believe theopposite is true: how we engage with one another matters a greatdeal, because our work is with people and the quality of our workproduct is entirely based on the ideas we create together. How webehave toward one another, therefore, shapes our creative work aswe are co-creating. In the past, we were complicit in letting strategy get created by an elite few, relinquishing our responsibility to rightly share in itscreation. All that changes now. Along with our core beliefs and ourrules of engagement, the way we behave as individuals and as leadersmust transform. We are not only allowed to shape strategy anddebate ideas, but we must do so. Therefore, how we act and express ourselves individually is the first place to start. === Page 60 === 40Part I is organized into two chapters. Chapter 2 discusses the role each of us plays in the system, and Chapter 3 covers the role played by some as we lead . After we define how the participants engage the system, we’ll move onto Part II: how the specific steps and actionsmust also change. That’ll show us the way in which how we act gets rolled into what we do. Let’s look at the ways of being that will help us end the cold war within our companies and organizations, and enable us to improve ourapproach to strategy creation. In that manner, the way of being is both personal and business. === Page 61 === Chapter 2dCHAPTER 2 Each of Us A bird the size of a leaf Fills the whole lucid evening With his note And flies. —Wendell Berry When Individuals Step Up Their Game, the Overall Game Gets Better At the midpoint in my career, one day I found myself considering a set of difficult questions: What would make me a more valuable con-tributor?

These questions surfaced shortly after I had won a key argument about how my firm’s marketing department should spend a $2 mil-lion budget most effectively to achieve the revenue target. I cared agreat deal about how they spent the money, because I was directlyaccountable for a significant $58 million chunk of revenue (out of$400 million overall). I was, of course, quite sure that my position on how to spend the money was correct. I had studied the issues carefully, formed airtightarguments that supported my position, and worked the halls to buildpolitical alliances. To further increase my chances of winning, I told === Page 62 === Chapter 2 42people why my opponent, the marketing lead, didn’t really “get” the business. And I had no trouble publicly highlighting the flaws in thelogic of her arguments and opinions. In the end, the decision was rendered in my favor and I received grand accolades from the higher ups. I won. I won because I hadarmed myself with facts and details. I won because I was argumenta-tive enough and persuasive enough to convince stakeholders and deci-sion makers alike that Iwas right. But at some level I also won by attacking a colleague. Unfortunately, I did not feel like had I won. I felt hollow. Yes, I had won the battle (as I had many times before), but somehow I didn’tfeel triumphant; I felt troubled. Something wasn’t right. Up to that point, my work experience had led me to the idea that external trappings of leadership were the goal: actionable insights,responsibilities of budget and people, advanced degrees, drive anddetermination, status, organizational power, title, etc. And after win-ning that battle, I had more of that stuff than before. Yet I did notenjoy the outcome. Something—some valuable quality—wasmissing. If it wasn’t missing from the results, then where was itmissing? I realized that it was missing from the substance of my being inside this corporation. By “substance of being,” I’m referring to myidentity, and to the quality and nature of my interactions witheveryone I worked with. In fact, to some degree, I did not really workwith many of my colleagues. I worked near them or around them, but notwith them. I was not, in a word, collaborative.

Until I understood that disappointing win, I didn’t get that how I won mat- tered a great deal. It turns out that, in this case, it mattered in severalways, and each way became a lesson. It mattered personally. Remarkably, I already held a core belief in collaboration. But in my striving, I had lost the sense for how thatneeded to play out within the organization. It sounds trite, butLesson 1 was that I had been neglecting one of my own values torespect all people, and as a result I had violated that core value. Andthat’s why I was troubled. === Page 63 === Each of Us 43Lesson 2 was that stepping on other people to force the “right” deci- sion contributed to an environment where others did not want tospeak up. When the multitudes of voices are stifled or silenced, ideasand initiative get lost. My behavior, along with executive support forit, undermined the sense of safety that lets people take risks insidethe organization. My actions were creating the opposite of a collabo-rative culture. So, even if my spending preference was good for thefirm, my style of winning did not benefit the organization. Did it help me personally? Actually, no. Lesson 3 was that I didn’t benefit in the long run, since many colleagues lost their ability totrust me, which made my job a lot harder after my “victory.” Each of these lessons is about the way I got what I wanted. I cer- tainly did not aim to be “The Villain” of the story, but I did not know a better way at the time to get the “right” outcome. Like others, I wasmissing a mental model that would help me see how my behaviorhelped define a culture that lowered the effectiveness of the wholecompany. In retrospect, I could see that what each of us does is only part of our contribution. We also need to know how to show up, how to act toward others…in other words, how to be.

Perspective Change Without a change in our individual “how,” a larger organizationalshift to collaborative strategy is not possible. The question becomes, “How does each of us create the most value for ourselves as individuals while enabling value creation for our teams and for the business as a whole?” Each of us, of course, worksat creating value at all these levels, and more. Our firms seek to addvalue to the larger industry, and that industry hopes to add value notjust for the shareholders but to society at large. Creating value fuelsbusinesses. It’s why we come to work, because I’m fairly sure most ofus don’t get out of bed each morning just to push paperwork around === Page 64 === Chapter 2 44(or win an argument on how a marketing budget is spent). At our best, each one of us comes to work to create and to contribute to thelarger whole. Curiously, I don’t know many people who define success in terms of adding value. 1Even fewer talk about the personal choices that underlie that definition. Instead, most of us fixate on other indicators asmeasures of success, starting with GMAT scores, top-10 schools, andgraduate degrees. Then it’s where we worked, and to whom wereported or had lunch with. Or it’s our title, or which VCfunded ourstartup at what valuation. Although we wave these banners as proof of success, they are more symbolic of positional power than of value created. The symbols cer-tainly don’t express the many small, tough choices people make dayin and day out that translate into value creation inside a system. Out-ward symbols don’t measure talent, contribution levels, passion,wisdom, or leadership ability. Titles, degrees, and affiliations mighthint at the choices someone has made for how to be at work, but they are not the choices themselves, nor are they indicators or measures ofvalue created. To be deeply successful, we must recognize how significantly our individual approach impacts the effectiveness of the teams and largerorganizations in which we work. This is a fundamental shift in per-spective from the plain “what” we do to the richer “what and how”we do work. Outward signs (titles, affiliations) don’t measure the choices we’ve made for how to be at work, nor do they indicate value created. At what time is the how of",

It is most important during times of stress, when we most need others to share their best ideas to define a new map forward. In short, nowhere isour “what and how” approach more important than when we arecollaborating to set direction for the company by creating strategies. === Page 65 === Each of Us 45So how do we do this? This chapter is about how each of us can shift our perspective away from an exclusive focus on the “what” of whatwe do, and include the “how” of how each of us works. Beyond the Title Think about your work not in terms of what you do, but in terms of therole you play. Your role is not just your title, but includes sets of behaviors, tools, and approaches to create value for and with yourorganization. The individual’s role in collaborative strategy demandsthat each of us learn how to make new choices about who we aregoing to be at work, regardless of our job title or where we happen tobe employed at any given moment. Our assignment is to break thesystemic issues we discussed in Chapter 1. Regardless of your formal title, you play various roles at work. Some- times it involves leading people and sometimes not. Most leadershipbooks tend to emphasize how to use leadership to improve the waypeople work. Very few books are written about how we as individ-uals can improve the way we all work together by altering the littlechoices we make in how we go about creating and adding value.Despite this gap, most of us have little trouble picturing a model col-laborator. We may work with someone like that: the kind of personeveryone hopes is on their team. Hardworking, high integrity,curious, easy to get along with, but also able to ask the tough ques-tions and challenge everyone to do their best. It’s easy to think interms of playing the role of the great team member, but it’s oftenhard to define the specific actions or behaviors. I hope this chapter will stimulate a New How for how each of us shows up at work, and about how each of us interacts with our col-leagues. My goal here is not to tell you exactly what to do, but toprovide a construct; it’s up to you to decide what you want to take inand commit to. So, before you dig in, take a moment and",

How do I contribute today to the organiza-tion’s larger success, independently of my formal title, positionalpower, or budget authority? Am I enabling the larger organization,and specifically my colleagues, to be successful through my indi-vidual way of being? === Page 66 === Chapter 2 46Do you have your answers to those questions? OK. Then let’s proceed. In the quest to consider a new way to engage at work and to become who each of us wants to be professionally, we need to let go of tradi-tional definitions of workplace roles, which are sometimes moretroublesome than useful in this area of collaborative work. There is avast crevasse between people in the role of employee and people inthe role of executive in business today. Generally speaking, people ineach group view their counterparts as “the other.” Strategy creationand execution missteps generate reactions like “The execs didn’t getthe strategy right” or “The employees failed to execute.” This classicus-versus-them dynamic contributes to the Air Sandwich describedearlier, where the strategy is based on a clear vision and future direc-tion on the top layer, and day-to-day actions are represented on thebottom, but virtually nothing connects the vision to direction toreality. This us-versus-them pattern promotes a situation in which both the executives and the employees look for “plausible deniability” ofresponsibility for any poor results. If things don’t work out as well asthey should have, they can just blame “the other” and avoid consid-ering how they themselves might be implicated. And when westruggle to make progress, the divisive us-versus-them battles impedethe larger organization from moving forward together and sharingthe ownership for creating new strategies. To counter this us-versus-them dynamic and establish conditions that improve our chances for winning, each of us must get beyondthe artificial boundaries that traditional role designations define andreinforce. Do your best to stick those traditional, formal, or organiza-tional labels in some mental cupboard. In place of those confiningroles, I suggest that you consider becoming a co-creator. Each of Us: Co-Creator Being a co-creator is a new way of characterizing yourself, one thatlets you focus on the value you can create, independent of theformal role you have. It gives you a way of morphing from an indi-vidual asset limited by organizational hierarchy to a contributor who === Page 67 === Each of Us 47recognizes that everything you do creates a ripple effect in the organi- zation (Figure 2-1).

Each of us becomes responsible for co-creatingthe basis of success. And this is critical, because the business worldis moving to a place where creativity drives results and ideas arebecoming the core of strategic and competitive advantage. Once upon a time, some firms had more access to data and informa- tion than others. Some firms had more skill at slicing and dicing. Inthat time, heavy-duty data analysis was enough to form a competi-tive advantage. Today, everybody has access to vast amounts of high-quality information and the tools to crunch it. What matters now isthe ability to act on that information: to conceive—now—the nugget of hidden opportunity in a given situation. The key is being able towork with one another and come up with new ideas, build on thoseideas, and then add insights based on the data that empower us toact in unique and differentiated ways. It’s not as if we used to be robotic “knowledge workers,” copying and collating and answering email, but now any sign of routineactivity is going out the door.

Perhaps you kept quietinstead of questioning something your boss proposed, or chose notto contribute on a project because it wasn’t your “assigned” role, orheld back while others developed strategy because it “wasn’t yourresponsibility.” Or maybe it wasn’t what you did but how you did it.

The point here is not to dwell onthe past, but rather to recognize that there is room for change. A co-creator focuses on advocating, championing, and lobbying for the best idea to help the com-pany to win, regardless of his or her role in an organization. When we make these poor choices, we are stepping back instead of stepping up. When people lean back, the strategy creation processdoesn’t get all the fuel it needs to generate a well-formed strategy thatwould enable the company to succeed. Critical information about thecompany’s situation in the market might be missing. Informationabout the organization’s true capacity is absent. Almost certainly, theresulting strategy would lack some degree of commitment on the partof those who need to implement it. === Page 69 === Each of Us 49And that’s got to change. The shift involves two things. The first is your willingness to speak up and give voice to your point of viewabout what you know to be true. The second is to remember that adecision not to act or not to speak is just that: a decision. It’s whenthis voice is let out that it can change the outcome. Held quiet, itnever has a chance. Until now, the executive team has owned strategy the noun, and no one has taken ownership of strategizing as the verb. Executives histori-cally have claimed responsibility for setting the direction that pro-duced “the strategy,” and drove a culture that established the AirSandwich. By not treating strategy as a recurring, progressive processthroughout the organization, these executives are encouraging poorbusiness outcomes. Here is a story about Arthur, the vice president of product manage- ment for an $8B consumer products company. Arthur’s story high-lights how we can add more value as a co-creator: Arthur is a very intelligent executive in an interesting situation. Year after year, his company is losing market share and he isn’t doing any-thing about it. Arthur feels constrained by the expectations that hebelieves his boss, the CEO, has of him. Arthur’s formal role is to setproduct direction. The company is facing a set of complex industrytrends and dynamics that are making the firm’s products increas-ingly irrelevant in their current markets. Arthur has a strong gutsense of what the company needs to do to turn the situation around.Arthur is in an ideal position to see",

Interestingly, in private, one-on-one meetings, Arthur will say, “Look, I only have charter for ‘x’—I’m only allowed to do ‘y.’” As aresult, Arthur won’t bring up his ideas to the other executives, letalone lobby or champion for them inside the organization to makethem actually work, because he doesn’t believe he has that authority. What should Arthur do? If Arthur can’t drive product strategy, who can? While none of us wants to see ourself as like Authur, we all do this to some degree. We limit ourselves to what we believe others expect ofus (based on our role or job description). So in this way, this chapteris about you: it’s about you being able to champion ideas regardless === Page 70 === Chapter 2 50of any specific role you have, and take on a role to help people see ideas in such a way that they want to act on them. It is about you,not as a “direct report” or as somebody who is a leader of others, but you as a co-creator—of insights, of creativity, of innovation, of con-tributions to your organization. Let’s go forward recognizing thatalthough coming up with new ideas and being smart is essential, itisn’t enough to succeed. Being smart is just the beginning of being aco-creator. Smarts let you be the champion for the right thing, whichis incredibly important. The difference is that you don’t just want tomake a smart argument, you want to turn those smarts into a focuson championing for the right solution. So what will it take for you to become the strongest contributor to strategy creation that you can be? Let me share a secret: it’s not aboutgetting smarter. Sure, strategy frameworks, business models, marketknowledge, and domain expertise are essential to strategy creation.But creating great strategy also involves being a good participant in astrategy creation process. And being a good participant is aboutengaging people in a difficult process, seeing together what matters ina given situation, and together making difficult trade-offs withinsight. In other words, becoming the strongest contributor possibleinvolves the set of choices you make in your interactions with othersto achieve shared success.

Youmake choices about which ideas matter, which ideas you want tochampion, when to assert your point of view, and what is worthadvocating for the business to consider. Some choices are about leading people and leading the processes. We’ll cover those kinds of choices in detail in Chapter 3. Right now, let’s look at how each of us can participate in strategy creation as a peer. We want to achieve two objectives with respect to choices. First, wewant to be more thoughtful and less automatic in all our choices, notjust the big ones. And second, we want to establish a clear sense of“targeted intentionality”—that is, we need to be aware of the subtleimpact on the big picture that we are looking to achieve through the === Page 71 === Each of Us 51sum of our small and large choices. The tools that we will use to achieve these objectives are embodied in the following five practices.These practices will help raise your level of consciousness aboutchoices that you are already making at work every day. If the prac-tices seem a bit edgy, it is because they are intended to stimulate yourthinking as you reimagine ways you can be more influential in howstrategy gets created and how you contribute your ideas to the mix.Co-creating is also challenging, and you may find that some of thepractices are at the edge of (or even a bit outside) your comfort zone.You may find that you will be expanding your comfort zone as youengage in co-creation. The practices are also designed to help you seethe larger impact of your choices. The five practices are: •Call out •Be fully present •Understand the why •Live in a state of discovery •Embrace contradiction Let’s explore each of these practices in depth, to start thinking about how using these steps when you do strategy creation in your com-pany will change the culture of work. Call Out Often in folklore we hear about powerful magical dragons or beastswe could control if we just knew their names. Calling stuff out withinorganizations is just like that. When we call things out, we take awaytheir power. Calling out brings issues to light and helps an organiza-tion address them. In our role as co-creators, we must fully engageideas that matter, even when they are unpopular. Co-creators will make choices that demonstrate a bit of boldness as they challenge thestatus quo by identifying and discussing topics",

Do you see the issues when revenue forecasts are missed? Do you see gaps between divisions where ideas are getting lost? Do you see perti-nent information being withheld? This ability to see and—more === Page 72 === Chapter 2 52importantly—to call out what you see is the first thing you can do to start leading change. Calling out starts with understanding the current state of your orga- nization with as much curiosity and clarity as you can. Your ability tocall out depends on your ability to see. Get clear on where your orga-nization has strengths, weakness, blind spots, and patterns that don’tserve the needs of the company. Identify where there are issues thatneed to be addressed. Find a way to talk about it that is direct andhonest, but holds back on judgment or blame. When you call out,you say things like: “I see us addressing only A here and not B” or “Itappears the root cause of this issue is X, Y, and Z” or “This issue canbe traced back to last year, when we terminated a product line.” Seekto express observations without blame or judgment. Calling out adds clarity to a discussion. It helps everyone recognize the company’s current state, and gets people to deal with the realityof a situation, instead of what they think is happening or want tobelieve is happening. When issues go undeclared, then teams, divi-sions, and even whole companies can spend their time and resourceson projects that don’t create value for the organization. Work atseeing these issues, and when you see them, call them out. Be the kidwho called out that the emperor wasn’t wearing any clothes. If youhave a naked emperor, everybody should know about it. Here are three recurring scenarios in companies where calling out isn’t happening: •The company fails to acknowledge why customers are defecting,so people work on product features instead of fixing the cus-tomer service experience, for example. •The company wishes to defeat the competition, but rather thangiving customers the features they need, the company focuses onnew technology. •The company does not recognize that a viable alternative to itsproducts or services has entered the market, and continues toraise prices, unaware that their offering is becoming obsolete. These examples show why calling out is valuable in terms of strategy.Calling things out helps prepare",

That said, calling out can be challenging. Have you ever kept your mouth shut in a meeting because you thought you’d be crucified if youdissented from the group norm? Have you held back your opinionbecause you wanted more time to research the issue? Have you everagreed to something with the positive belief that somehow your teamcould figure it out? Calling out takes courage and commitment, becausethere is always ambiguity. I might be crucified. I’m not sure if research would support me. It’s possible my team can deliver to that aggressive date. In these situations, it’s easier to: •Convince ourselves that others know better (without actuallychecking) •Focus on only a part (the safe part) of what is there •Keep quiet (even though you’re sure) All these alternatives to calling out are tactics to avoid pain. Pre-tending that others know better is an easy way to avoid the responsi-bility for fixing it. Similarly, when you focus on one part of whatexists, you limit your responsibility and risk. After all (you tell your-self), dealing with part of a problem is better than nothing. But onlywhen the full set of issues is known and the choice is explicit.Figure 2-2. Calling things out is crucial to success === Page 74 === Chapter 2 54Working on one piece as a way to avoid issues comes with a risk: you may be solving a symptom instead of the root cause. Keeping quiet is one of the techniques that all of us use (I’m not immune, either) to avoid extra work or embarrassment. After all, evenAbraham Lincoln said: “Better to remain silent and be thought a foolthan to speak out and remove all doubt.” He was joking, of course; hedidn’t move the nation forward by keeping silent. Nor can we move ourcompanies forward by doing the same. We adopt these human tendencies to protect ourselves, but consis- tently avoiding short-term pain is a trap that results in long-termproblems. When we make the choice to begin calling out, we arebeing subtly courageous, taking appropriate action even though weknow there is a risk",

It is not about doomsaying or “talking trash,” both of which focus onthe negative. Doomsaying dwells unproductively on potentially nega-tive outcomes that have already been raised and considered. Trash-talking is exaggerating the faults of an organization or its products.Neither has any constructive intent, and neither is part of calling out.Calling out is an inherently positive activity, because until your com- pany can identify its issues, the team cannot jointly decide how torespond to it. As you begin to engage in calling out, you will find many opportuni- ties. Should you leap at every opportunity to declare the unspokentruth? You will need some practice to develop a sense for the best sit-uations and best language to use when calling out. But that skill willonly come through exercise. The thing that doesn’t work is avoidingcalling out altogether. Once you see what needs to be solved and name it, the next action you can take to lead change is to begin a dialogue and engage theissues. Did Wonder Woman walk away from the tough stuff?

One of the most important choices you make at work everyday—consciously or not—is how you choose to show up! Many people think they are not supposed to question or weigh in, because they don’t have a certain title, or a certain authority, or a cer-tain level of leadership. None of us needs a designated role to have apoint of view. That’s old-school thinking, and it’s totally unhelpfulwhen creating great strategy. Strategy creation is about understanding, debating, and co-building ideas. Generating great strategies is the creative act of people on ateam. Why does that matter? Because if you’re not in the room to advo-cate, deliberate, and contribute what you have to offer—essentially, tofight over the value of ideas for the benefit of the company—then youand your firm are missing a huge opportunity.

And it’s certainly better to lookdumb and learn than to keep quiet and stay uninformed. If we’re notwilling to risk being seen as ignorant by saying “I don’t know” everyonce in a while, we won’t leave ourselves open to learning. It’s asmall act of courage to admit that you have more to learn. Andthere’s a good chance that others need more information as well. Ourability to learn and grow is the single biggest factor that propels oursuccess. Sure, it’s not funto look stupid or silly sometimes, but the fear of looking bad can be a major obstacle to your own contribution. It’s certainly better to look dumb and learn than to keep quiet and stay uninformed. It’s called the courage to learn.Figure 2-3. Looking stupid takes courage === Page",

What would it take for you to say what you actually think? What do you need to do to be fully present inyour work? Spend some time on these important questions. Fear is the main factor that prevents most people from being fully present. Fear is not always a bad thing. It is information, and itsvalue depends on the context and how you react to it. If we alwaysreact to fear with a pattern of avoidance, that is very costly. If wetreat fear as a signal to pay close attention, then it is very useful.That’s how I try to respond to feelings of fear. When I hear the voiceof fear in my head, I stop and listen, because it is telling me there isprobably some danger I need to account for in my thinking. Fear can be a paralyzing force that prevents you from saying what is true for you. Or it can be a clear signal that you need to pay atten-tion to something important. Listen not only to what people aresaying, but also pay special attention to the needs or fears under- neath their words. As described in the sidebar “What They Mean to Say” on page 58, it took time to dig through the fear, but underneath it was a valid issuethat the whole group needed to hear and consider. To be fully present means being willing to share everything—your insights, your perspectives, your questions, your worries, and yourfears—because you know that your contributions will benefit thegroup. When we don’t share and reveal with candor what we reallyneed, critically important “stuff” goes underground, which makes itmore difficult to consciously manage for optimal business outcomesand often results in unintended consequences. Pushing stuff under-ground creates the opposite of what we want. To improve ourchances of choosing the right strategies and executing them well, weneed to share with people why we want or need something. Knowingthis lets others help us achieve our intended outcomes in ways thatmight not be obvious at first. Ultimately, it’s the benefits of transpar-ency and a transparent culture that we aim to enable.

Author Virender Kapoor says, “It is not your === Page 78 === Chapter 2 58intelligence quotient (IQ), but your passion quotient (PQ) that will take you to the pinnacle of success.” He’s right, and that’s theessence of being fully present. When you are fully present, you bring your passion to the table. Learning to bring your passion is instrumental to being a better strate-gist. Here are some simple ways to practice being present: •Share your needs, desires, ideas, thoughts, questions, and fearswith others.What They Mean to Say I once found myself working with an executive team that had just been locked in a conference room with an order from the CEO to “cut costsnow.” We were given 23 hours to figure out what to cut and what tospare. We spent the better part of the day bickering over who could giveup what, and at some point one of the guys announced, “I will not cutany part of my team.” As you can imagine, this didn’t sit well with any-body. The others quickly ganged up on him. At some point, someone intervened by asking the guy to share his rea- soning (as opposed to his ultimatum). He replied that he had built theteam from scratch and hired each person. This was largely true foreveryone in the room, so his answer was insufficient. The voice in myhead said, “Get real!” But I pushed my frustration aside and asked ifthere was something else he wasn’t saying. And that’s when we got tothe essence of the situation. He explained that his team was made up of the best people in the indus- try. They all lived in the same city and worked well together. He worriedthat if he fired one of them, they would all leave to form their own com-pany and become his division’s competitor. Not only would he lose stel-lar employees, he would have to face a much tougher fight in the marketdownstream. The truth for this guy was finally revealed. In speaking thistruth, he had finally chosen to be fully present. There was an audible,collective sigh in the room. Everybody now understood what was atstake. Revealing this executive’s fear changed the whole dialogue in the room. The team immediately began to have a much richer discussion abouttrade-offs and what they ultimately wanted. In the end, they made cer-tain that the cuts they",

There is always a second chance. The next not-so-obvious way you can participate in strategy creationis to make sure you know the “why” of a decision. Understand the Why Some people feel like they shouldn’t share why decisions are madethe way they are. This can include sharing what data was used toinform the decision, which people weighed in, or what risks wereconsidered. If, say, only a small group of leaders knows why decisions are being made the way they are, it leaves the rest of the organization in thedark. It suggests to people that there’s some “all-powerful wizard”behind the mysterious curtain who is the only one with the ability tomake things happen, and that each of us is not a co-creator. It canleave the organizational players believing they have no say in what isbeing decided. By now, you know these two outcomes are taboo. Everyone is better off when they know why decisions are made with as much accuracy as possible. It gives them an understanding of whatmatters and provides information on which to base the trade-offsconstantly being made at every level. It also boosts buy-in and energyfrom the organization. When reasons behind decisions are notshared, the decisions can seem arbitrary and possibly self-serving.That is, they may seem like they are made for the good of the decisionmakers, rather than the good of the organization. When the “why” is unknown, decisions can seem arbitrary and self-serving. When the “why” isknown, it raises everyone’s ability to align subdecisions. === Page 80 === Chapter 2 60We need our people to bring their full brainpower to the game and devise the best ways to get from “here” to “there.” That meanssharing data and assumptions freely so you get a full organization ofgreat strategic thinking.

Inany case, choosing to withhold contradictory data is tricky, since thepeople who already know that data will get the sense that the deci-sion makers were in the dark and that the decision was flawed.Again, more informed now equals more aligned later. Transparency ultimately gives people the power to adjust the aim when needed, and yet stay in full alignment with the larger whole.Transparency from decision makers also encourages transparencyelsewhere, so that useful but inconvenient tidbits of informationthroughout the organization are not swept under the rug. The good news here is that even if you did nothing other than calling things out, you still would lead change in your organization. To lead more change, you could be fully present, actively leading by example and bringing a new power to your organization. To lead even more change, you can choose to drive organizational transparency. Thesechoices are yours, and that’s an awful lot of power one person can have. These actions, when combined, provide a solid place to start leading change inside your organization. Remember, Margaret Mead oncesaid, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citi-zens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”We are the citizens in the world of our organizations. The kind ofchange that propels our companies forward can start with each of us,if we choose to be thoughtful and committed.

Great strategy is at its very core about designing the future, and what it will take to realize that future. If we are not in a state of discovery,we limit the number of possibilities we imagine, invent, and strive forin the future. When we endeavor to live in a state of discovery, weare willing to engage new ideas and revisit assumptions. With prac-tice, we find it easier to let go of earlier ideas to build different ones,and thus tend to be open to the contributions of others. This has aninteresting byproduct. When we loosen our grip on our own pointof view in order to see others’ points of view, we stop appearing“political” to others. Living in a state of discovery is an active choice. It means consciously continuing to expand our mental frameworks, and staying open tonew knowledge, new insights, and new experiences. I call this “beingcurious”: being inquisitive about the world, about other people’spoints of view, about how things work around you, and even aboutnew notions of yourself. If all that sounds positive and exciting,understand that living in a state of discovery also means beingwilling to accept facts we don’t like, and being able to see old factsin a new way. Staying curious and open helps each of us stay mentally agile. By contrast, when we treat our experience, knowledge, or insights as“complete” or “done,” we limit ourselves to the past rather thanembracing the future. As long as we restrict incoming data sets, wescreen out the good ideas along with the bad. We lose essential infor-mation, constricting our ability to invent, reinvent, and create (andco-create) the future. === Page 82 === Chapter 2 62One common challenge in adopting a state of discovery is learning to listen. That seems obvious, but again we must resist some of our nat-ural instincts to listen well. Listening is particularly hard when wehave some perspective or concept that we truly value, a key insight orpiece of data that we want to share. In our desire to “express,” wesometimes focus more on outbound flow rather than capturinginbound insights.

In the long run, what truly matters is not what each of us knows today, but our ability to continue expanding the aperture of whateach of us can see and understand tomorrow. In the short run, any ofus can strengthen our skills by learning how to ask good questions. Living in a state of discovery is an ongoing practice. It is a muscle you can constantly flex, exercise, stretch, and strengthen. By choosing tobe curious and accepting of other points of view, you can move froman unconscious preoccupation with your view of reality to beingopen to new ideas, differing points of view, new scenarios, andunpredicted realities (Figure 2-4). This openness will strengthen rela-tionships and certainly help each of us become a wiser strategist.This is a necessary ingredient in good collaborative strategy cre-ation. In other words, each of us must be willing to set aside thepreconceived notions we might have about somebody else, just as weneed to stay open to the idea that they might have preconceivednotions about us! Learning to live in a state of discovery can be a challenge, given the day-to-day and moment-to-moment pressure we experience on the job.Here are some straightforward techniques to begin developing thiscritical skill: •Enter meetings with the intention of asking at least three open-ended questions. These questions should not be about gatheringbasic facts or about binary issues where a simple “yes” or “no”could suffice, but perhaps about what matters and what is possi-ble. For introverts, some preparation can help them know whatthey want to explore. For extroverts, it is more about makingsure to ask questions that create more learning. === Page 83 === Each of Us 63•Set a goal for yourself to be in “discovery mode.” There are times in any project where it is clear you need to know more beforeyou even know what questions need to be asked and answered. •Stop silently criticizing yourself and others for not knowing theanswer already. Interestingly, really bright people often make itharder on themselves than necessary by judging themselves fornot already knowing. Judgment of yourself and others is bestcurtailed, because it interferes with your ability to be open tolearning. To be open to a new reality is to set aside judgment, ifonly for a while.

Embrace Contradiction One of the toughest things about being a strategist and a co-creator isthat almost all of the easy problems have already been solved by thetime you arrive. The easy issues involve decisions that are relativelystraightforward and linear, with clear cost-benefit trade-offs. Thismeans that the investments and the barriers to action are largelyabout money and resources. An example might be a run-of-the-millFigure 2-4. Open to a new reality === Page 84 === Chapter 2 64marketing program where the decision is clear and resources need to be allocated. Difficult problems, however, occur when you are breaking new ground. Solving such problems requires that both the means and theends be found. They are often intuitive or holistic decisions whereeven the process of discovery itself can be transformative. The com-plexity of these types of decisions usually means they are mired inresistance that borders on open conflict. To solve the problem, the organizations and humans involved will need to change and adapt insome yet-undefined way. A typical strategic decision is a new marketentry or an integration of two companies. Strategy creation for difficult problems, therefore, is incredibly com- plex by its very nature. It’s rarely clear what the “answer” is, becausethe problem itself often is not clear. When you roll up your sleevesand dig in, you find a situation of deep complexity where nosolution appears ideal. The hallmark of thorny strategy problems is that theyinvolve contradiction—that is, they contain a set of conflicting goalsor imperatives that create a tension that defies objective resolution.Either something about the future conflicts with some aspect of thepresent, or two aspects of the future conflict with each other. If this were not true, the problem would be straightforward. Your intuitive sense for resolution will often differ from someone else’s intuition.And that, of course, is the challenge to arriving at a solution manypeople can get behind. The hallmark of complex problems is paradox. Doris Kearns Goodwin, one of my all-time favorite authors, wrote adefinitive book on Abraham Lincoln and his Cabinet called Team of Rivals (Simon & Schuster). In her book, she characterizes what so many great leaders do when dealing with contradiction. Goodwinstates that when Lincoln assumed his presidency, he rounded up his“enemies” and invited them to join his Cabinet. He assembled a teamof his adversaries and put them to work for him. At that time, slaverydrove the business of agriculture, and agriculture was the engine of",

Depending on aperson’s perspective, slavery was either vital or an abomination. Opponents of the Civil War criticized Lincoln for refusing to com- promise on the issue of slavery. Others criticized him for moving tooslowly to abolish slavery. Lincoln assembled his political adversariesinto his Cabinet knowing he needed their gifts. According toGoodwin, Lincoln, like other great leaders, did not merely toleratecontradictory points of view; he encouraged them. In the end, every single Cabinet member helped to shape post–Civil War America.Today, we all recognize slavery as a cruel human tragedy. But inLincoln’s time, the issue of slavery was an economic and moralcontradiction. Contradiction is inherent in all decisions involving significant change. When each of us can live with and explore opposing ideas,we create the space to generate more creative solutions than we firstthought were possible. At the time of the Civil War, many felt itwould be impossible to reconcile our differences and continue as onenation. Yet we were able to change and progress. To develop as a strategist and co-creator, each of us will eventually internalize the notion that developing good strategy for complex busi-ness problems involves opposing ideas living in tension. There is rarelyjust one right answer when dealing with complex business problems.Those who constantly insist on black and white perspectives will findprogress a constant struggle. Don’t just tolerate contradiction; embrace it and work with it. Learning to embrace contradiction is uncomfortable for most people. That said, it’s richly rewarding because it allows us to takeon tough debates and likely uncover tacit issues, and empowerseach of us to arrive at a solution that couldn’t be devised without adeep understanding of the situation. Here are a few techniques to start embracing contradiction: •Notice how much you value certainty versus uncertainty on any given decision, or peace over conflict. There is no right or wronganswer, but you need to know where your natural set point is soyou can manage it during strategy creation. === Page 86 === Chapter 2 66•Rate how important certainty or peacemaking is to you, and try increasing your tolerance for uncertainty or conflict in smallincrements. If you find yourself appeasing people to createpeace, you are simply camouflaging the problem and it will onlycontinue to get worse. •Ask yourself,",

Referto Appendix B for more information on dealing with contradiction. Sitting Forward, Going Forward We are constantly facing choices in our workplace. On the one hand,we constantly see issues that ought to be addressed today, if notsooner. On the other hand, we are tempted to choose the safety andcomfort of checking out and “going with the flow.” Why rock theboat? Why risk being wrong? Why risk a potential conflict? Isn’t itsafer to just avoid the risk of being wrong? Wouldn’t keeping quietbe a lot more comfortable than dealing with the issues head-on? For those of us who seek to do the best thing for our firms, to be strategists and co-creators, the choices are clear, even if they aren’teasy. It might seem safer, more comfortable, and easier to sit back,but we know underneath, it’s actually not. We know that if we dothis, we’re depriving the organization of what we know, our insights,and our particular perspective. Our viewpoints can be crucial tohelping the company to win. And if the company doesn’t win, noneof us win. In order to fill in the Air Sandwich, we can’t afford to play only our formal, defined individual roles and neglect what’s going on withinthe team and the business’s “field of play.” Adopting the five principles in your individual role is about sitting forward. Sitting forward is a way to meet the world so that you are ready for action—ready to listen, to learn, to connect disparate ideas, to help advance options, to create, and ultimately to make somethingreal. You are engaging with the world, not witnessing it passively. === Page 87 === Each of Us 67When applied to strategy creation, your involvement is highlighting what’s most important, thus shaping the criteria; making sure theright facts are gathered; weighing in on what will work or not; andultimately making sure that any potential “gap” between the visionand making that vision a reality gets addressed and closed. When you make a decision to sit forward, the kinds of problems you deal with may not change, but your appreciation of them will. And,hopefully, through your contribution, others will also appreciate thesituation more fully. This basic stance of collaborative engagement is what drives many people to exhibit great leadership, brilliant",

Butsuccess doesn’t come from action alone; success comes from a posi-tion or a stance, a deeper way of being that consistently creates engaged behavior. You might find it beneficial to view the apparent problems and chal- lenges in your work life as opportunities to learn something, to makeyou stronger, to prepare you for something that might happen in thefuture so you’ll be ready. Although the benefits are not always immedi-ately obvious, when you sit forward and embrace problems instead ofavoiding them, you learn and grow, and thus get stronger more quickly. There is a saying in Eastern philosophy that goes: “If you have a fish in a pond and want it to get big and strong, put a stone in the middleof the pond. The fish will swim around and around the stone tryingto get to the other side.” 2It is in the fish’s nature to explore and move. It is a way of responding to the environment, of being activeand present to what can be. Just like the fish, each of us can choosehow we respond to our environment. We can choose to be passive inresponse to the stones in our pond, or we can engage with our envi-ronment. One mode definitely changes our relationship to our worldand the stance we take when we take on new challenges. One modemakes each of us stronger. As is evident, we can have a major impact by sitting forward. We can shift how our organizations create strategy today by calling out, beingfully present, understanding the why, living in a state of discovery,and embracing the contradiction inherent in complex decisions. === Page 88 === Chapter 2 68Each of us must do our part to find our voice and participate in the chorus of work going on around us. As we do this, we will start to change how we work together. You’ve likely seen these practices at work in real life. Perhaps not as often as is needed, and maybe not in your current organization, butyou’ve seen it. Recall your own experience of when a team is clickingand collaborating, and you’ll see that the members are living out thefive practices as a norm. These practices are not inherently hard, butthey do require personal strength, finding your voice to contributeas an equal member of a whole, and an intent to co-create the",

Not somesmallish cadre of “strategy leaders.” We each own our piece ofresponsibility and the load of carrying our part. Having each of uspick up that load and change how we approach work will enablecollaboration within organizations to take place systemically. Those who lead people or projects (in addition to being co-creators) will expect to carry specific responsibilities for enabling how we work together collaboratively. That’s next. === Page 89 === Chapter 3CHAPTER 3 As We Lead The road to success is dotted with many tempting parking places. —Will Rogers Enabling Organizational Velocity Some of us have the challenge of leading people and initiatives in addition to being champions of ideas. This expanded role offers a lotmore opportunities in the area of collaborative strategy creation. For most of us, leading is a privilege that comes in addition to our regular, everyday workloads, work that each of us must performflawlessly because resources—talent, budgets, headcount, andschedules—aren’t as abundant as we might want or need. Leadingcollaborative strategy is not as easy as it looks. Perhaps a story of a newly minted general manager will highlight the point. Not long ago, a Rubicon colleague asked me to take a meeting with Lucas, who had recently received a prestigious new role at a globalmedia company. The meeting was framed up as an opportunity toexplore creative new ways to drive “exponential growth” in whatpundits might very well consider a mature business unit. We talked over lunch at a bustling Greek restaurant. Lucas was sharp, creative, and ambitious. He came across as a confident executive and a === Page 90 === Chapter 3 70strong leader. Nearly two hours disappeared as we spoke about corpo- rate and divisional strategic issues, focused intensely on the questionsrelated to growth. We talked about Lucas’s passion for his productsand services, and the initiatives he wanted to start and the goals hehad. He shared a plethora of detailed facts, keen observations, andexpansive ideas. In particular, his division’s current annual revenue was $338M, and he believed that his division was well positioned to outpace theoverall company’s expected low double-digit growth rate. Based onhis fresh perspective and new understanding of the dynamics drivinghis business, Lucas had concluded that it was possible to drive ittoward a much higher goal. Indeed, he",

Emphatically, Lucas told me that he wanted his team to step up and figure out how to tackle this huge potential opportunity. He recog-nized, however, that there was at least one obstacle. Lucas was self-aware enough to know that he was enmeshed in too much of histeam’s individual detail work. He observed himself offering morespecific direction than was appropriate given the talent of the peoplereporting to him. Plus, he had the vague sense his people weresomehow holding back. Between the talking, eating, and drinking, I began a mini-version of my Fact Gathering interview (which we’ll cover in Chapter 4) tolearn more about Lucas’s business and to explore various ways Imight be able to help him. We explored dozens of possibleapproaches to accelerate growth, and looked at creating new productand service offerings to crack open and win new markets. Whenever I asked Lucas a question that challenged his basic point of view, I saw his eyes light up. “Wow. That’s a good idea,” he wouldsay. Or, “Oh, I think that would work….” Lucas responded more passionately to a particular category of ques- tions than others: he had energy around optimizing channels of dis-tribution, creating new offers, performing customer requirementresearch, and conducting quantitative analysis. Questions that hadspecific and factual answers prompted Lucas to sit forward in hischair. === Page 91 === As We Lead 71In contrast, some questions didn’t move Lucas a bit. For example, he wasn’t terribly interested when I asked him questions like: “So what doyou do to generate ideas from your people?” or “Does your team believethis growth is possible, too?” or “Where, specifically, are your peoplelimited in their decision making and initiative?” His responses wereflat. At best, he would mutter something cordial or polite like,“Hmm. That’s probably worth looking into.” Over the next couple of days, I found myself mulling over the conver- sation, trying to put my finger on the source of Lucas’s mixedresponses to my questions. Only when I had consciously set the topicaside could I see the odd reality of the situation: Lucas was standingdirectly in his own way. Lucas was obviously interested in finding creative, innovative ways to win. There was absolutely no question he wanted to be a growth leader, to help his team take real ownership of market opportunities.However, it had become abundantly clear to me that Lucas’s naturalstrength as a gifted problem solver was",

This dynamic washolding Lucas back, as it does for many otherwise effective executives,and biasing him toward a definitive, smartest-guy-in-the-roomapproach to strategizing and winning. The very thing that helps leaders get to their role of leadership biases them toward a “smartest- guy-in-the-room” approach to strategizing. Even though Lucas was very much aware he needed his team to step up, he had not recognized his role in getting them to co-own prob-lems and co-create solutions. Meanwhile, the familiar territory oflargely solo problem solving had Lucas’s sharp intellect literallychamping at the bit. I’d seen this before. If my previous experience was any guide, Lucas’s personal challenge was due to conflicting imperatives. On the one hand, he believedhimself to be the champion who would be able to find the answers tothe tough questions that would ultimately lead to the success he envi- sioned. On the other hand, he was sensitive to the fact that his team, === Page 92 === Chapter 3 72not he alone, had the knowledge, talent, and capacity to step up and ultimately deliver those breakthrough results. Is it possible to doboth? Put another way, can someone in Lucas’s position simulta-neously find the strategy “answer” and get people to step up and engage? This question is the heart of the challenge for most executives. Talented people are chosen for leadership positions because they pos- sess some keen talent, insights, vision, and/or extraordinary problem-solving skills. And often they find it easier to exercise these skills than toteach them or coach others to use their talents more. To add to thechallenge, attempts to promote collaboration are often unrewarded inour current work culture. So it often happens that our Achilles heel asleaders is attempting to come up with the answers and solve the toughproblems by ourselves (Figure 3-1). Perhaps you see a bit of yourself in Lucas’s story? From your per- sonal experience, have you come to believe that you can solve prob-lems faster on your own than you would through any group effort?This is a dangerous type of trap for us leaders, because it lures us intobelieving that we alone can answer the most vexing questions andsolve the toughest problems. And so, rather than collaborating withthe people, engaging knowledge, and tapping into the talent withinthe organization, we go it alone. Figure 3-1.

This is more the norm than the exception, and the more complicated the business issue,the more likely people are to “go it alone.” The upshot is that leadersoften figure out “the answer” solo or in small groups, then set directionand tell their teams to “execute.” Voilà, the Air Sandwich is manifest,and organizational velocity is not achieved. Here is what I later said to Lucas—something I wish I could say to all GMs, VPs, directors, and managers in similar situations: The answer to today’s specific question is only that—part of the solu- tion to today’s problem. Next week’s problem will require a differentsolution. And next month’s question will need yet another answer.Crowning yourself the Chief of Answers puts you in a difficult posi-tion, one with very little advantage. It sets your team up to be theTribe of Doing Things. And, at the end of the day, you end up feedingthe very counterproductive cycle you need to alter. Our past successes bias us. They reinforce our tacit worldview that, as the smartest person in the room, we can avoid the messy dynamicsof group problem solving. All we need are access to credible data,great research, excellent analysis, and clever insights. Our past suc- cesses reinforce our misguided belief that we can come up with the beststrategic idea faster and far more efficiently on our own rather thanslowing down to collaborate with our people. The Chief of Answers model fails the organization on multiple levels. Here are a few: •Scalability. Having everything go through one leader (or a smallset of leaders) limits growth. The number of different kinds ofbusiness challenges grows as the market speeds up. The Chief ofAnswers cannot know the multitude of issues as well as the peo-ple who are closer to the problem. The speed of changing issues,the trend of that rate of change, and the speed at which the orga-nization must react is crucial to competitiveness going forward. •Ownership. When people understand the reasons things arebroken, why decisions are made the way they are, and so on,they ultimately own the thinking. This means they can own theoutcome. Without this understanding, only a few people feelownership for the success of the strategy; the rest are collectingpaychecks. === Page 94 === Chapter 3 74•Retention.

Sitting outside the room doesn’t motivate people.They want a seat at the table. When a Chief of Answers leads,the best people go to organizations where they can make a moremeaningful impact. The Chief of Answers model rests mostly on individual smarts. But weall know that setting direction requires more than an accumulation offacts, processes, formulas, and individual insights. It is about goingbeyond data, insights, and models. It’s about applying many differentperspectives and challenging the status quo, making shifts inside theorganization and jointly steering it toward a new, compelling future. It’sabout getting many people to understand, believe, co-create, and co-own the outcome of a strategy, thus turning a direction into reality. The End of the Era of the Chief of Answers When a leader crowns himself the Chief of Answers, making him thekey person responsible for driving all strategy, he creates a bottle-neck in the organization. By not involving other people in thestrategy process, things get bogged down (see Figure 3-2), and it’s astruggle to do strategy creation effectively. Under these conditions,his people will always be dependent on him, and he will be the lim-iter of what could otherwise develop into a fast, responsive, adaptiveorganization. What we want instead is a leader of co-creators. Recognizing and accepting that the Chief of Answers (CoA) model is obsolete is not always easy. Many of us began our careers during atime when that model was still well regarded, and we’ve invested a lotin building a set of skills and perhaps a reputation as Chief ofAnswers (though we don’t call it that; we use the terms “whiz kid”or “go-getter”). And some industries move slowly enough thatChiefs of Answers can still manage to keep up. But in the complexand dynamic industries, the CoA model is toast. RIP. And it’s crit-ical for this reality to be internalized by everyone who wants to leada vibrant and powerful team trying to win in those markets. There isa lot of commonality between the failures of the CoA model andwhy strategies have been failing. === Page 95 === As We Lead 75Responsiveness is key to future competitiveness.

Responding quickly and well depends on howquickly and accurately information and decisions flow through theorganization. Responsiveness also depends on how a company lis-tens, discerns, learns, and organizes itself to respond quickly to whatcustomers will pay for (knowing full well that what they say theywant today might change tomorrow). Many of today’s fast-paced industries were just about manageable 10 or 15 years ago, but since then all kinds of complications have beenlayered on. Outsourcing, localization, increased automation, openlicensing, shared APIs, Software as a Service (SaaS) models, and middle-ware dynamics can all be big factors in decisions, whereas they wereonly peripheral elements before. Our shift toward the “information economy” and “knowledge workers” means that we have few turn-the-crank jobs left. We haveleveraged machinery, software, and overseas labor farms to handle rou-tine and predictable work wherever possible so that we can compete.Predictably, our teams are now full of highly educated, experienced,specialized smart people doing work that requires care and judgment.Figure 3-2. Volume of strategies versus speed of market === Page 96 === Chapter 3 76On the one hand, we need these people to care about the work that they do, and on the other hand, we would love to take advantage ofwhat they see, anticipate, and imagine. We as their leaders want themto get what we’re envisioning, and tell us how it’s either wonderful orbroken. We want to know how they could make it better. We evenwant each of them to know what others are thinking, to generate con-cepts and solutions that would not have been conceivable otherwise. This model of a fully engaged “wisdom workforce” is incompatible with the CoA model. If you don’t actively engage people throughoutthe organization, you will struggle to get them to agree on what’s mostimportant and what success will look like. If you’ve hired well, thesepeople won’t be happy sitting on the bench; they want game time! Yet, according to research, we don’t treat them like participants and co-creators of the business outcome. Only 5% of the workforce understands its company’s strategy. 1Only 1 person in 20 is prepared to answer, clearly and realistically, what her company should be doing and how her individual efforts con- tribute to supporting it.

There’s a real potential to use the fuller organization to consider and make decisions quickly, based on information that comes from thedepths and edges of the company, from customers, partners, andsuppliers. This builds a team of professionals. The Goal Is Repeated Wins Existing or aspiring leaders who may see a bit of themselves inLucas’s story may be reacting to this collaborative workforce visionin two ways. First, it may seem as though I’m suggesting that you areno longer a key strategist. Second, you may wonder if you need a newskill set to be a leader of champions. To answer the first question, no, you’re not abdicating the role of key strategist. You’re simply gaining new leverage. Let’s put to rest thenotion that the goal is to get to one big win, because the ultimategoal isn’t to win once but rather to win over and over again. Asleaders, the way to do this is by increasing the quality of ideas andspeeding up decision making by helping our teams collaborate andco-create, and by distributing the ability to solve the toughest prob-lems throughout the organization. Together, this creates the condi-tions for our companies to outshine the competition by out-thinkingthem, out-creating them, and out-innovating them…repeatedly. And to answer the second question, yes, you’ll need some new approaches. You will want to shift the organizational processes thatinfluence how people input ideas, develop options, and make deci-sions. And we need to influence the protocols for how people vetideas and communicate risks and dependencies with one another, sothat decisions align to form a unified direction. The protocols mustallow for productive deliberations and checkpoints while avoidingred tape, bureaucracy, and politics. By keeping the focus on repeatedwins, you are avoiding the parking places on the road to success. === Page 98 === Chapter 3 78Transitioning to the Un-Hero With this in mind, the way you lead and set direction makes a big difference. How do you do this, you wonder? How do you help a group of people do more than just find the answers to their currentproblems? Is it really possible to help other people who are respon-sible for leading ideas to develop the ability to be more strategic onan ongoing basis and to think for the organization as a whole?

The short answer is this: you make clear that it matters, invite yourpeople to participate, ask them to help, and provide guidance. As welead, we have countless opportunities to speed up strategy creationand execution by facilitating conversations across organizationalsilos, divisions, functions, and departments. So, your job as a leadernow includes being a catalyst to connect people and help them com-bine forces, develop their ideas, and tap their collective knowledge,experience, and strengths. Rather than telling people what to do, youwill find opportunities to guide them by sharing your unique point ofview, by teasing out insights, concerns, requirements, needs, issues,and experiences, and by asking the question that is on everybody’smind regarding how the needs of the business might be addressed. Insome ways, your role is to be a new kind of corporate hero. Look, it’s only natural that each of us aspires to be a bit of a hero. And, as a collaborative strategy leader, you willbe a hero. But you’ll also be a kind of “un-hero.” Un-heros are essential. Even Batmanneeded the un-hero Alfred, because the hero character would be toofar-fetched without an amazing helper. You can be both Robin and Alfred to your team’s Batman. When you contribute toward fos-tering the new culture of collective strategy creation, you’re a hero!When you set the context and allow people to act as co-creators ofideas, you’re a hero!

You’ll have plenty to do as an “un-hero” because you willfacilitate as much as you decide, catalyze as much as you act, andcoach as much as you direct.

You will be the director of a sym-phony, playing a piece of music co-written by you and the orchestra.

The way you lead matters a lot, because you are the one nurturing anenvironment where people bring their creativity to bear. You are theone encouraging people to think about the problem with newoptions. You are the one encouraging them to own the solution sothat execution goes faster in the market. You are creating the forumwhere people give you and your organization what they most love—their ideas and passion.

Being a leader of co-creators is not for the weak-kneed andspineless. This type of leadership works only if the leader is ready tobring a certain amount of emotional maturity and intelligence. Youmay not have all the skills you need to do this kind of leadershiptoday, but if you can be aware of and self-manage your learningwithout fear, none of these skills is out of your grasp (see Figure 3-4). Engaging your team in a preview of the strategy while it’s being developed provides valuable exposure to the thinking around whatmatters to the organization. When the team knows what’s coming,they have an opportunity to think ahead, anticipate obstacles, andimagine possible solutions before the problems even arise. Thisthink-anticipate-imagine process also helps your team to get comfort-able with the idea of change. Their participation drives a legitimatesense of co-ownership in the ultimate decision. Understanding, readi-ness, and co-ownership together speed up conversations and improvethe quality of the strategy as it is being implemented.

Self-manage your own issues === Page 102 === Chapter 3 821.Manage Cadence 2.Generate Ideas 3.Nurture Safe Culture 4.Develop Connections 5.Satisfice 6.Engage Issues 7.Trace Topography To simplify the job of maintaining your awareness of these responsi- bilities, I’ve arranged their labels so that they spell out the word“mindset.” Let’s explore each of these responsibilities and why theyare part of the way we lead collaborative strategy. 1. Manage Cadence Managing cadence is about setting the pace. From your vantagepoint, you’ll show your team how they are progressing, so they cansense incremental accomplishment and thus maintain a sense of for-ward motion. You will always keep people informed to let themknow where they are and what other mountains lie ahead. You willuse whatever means are appropriate and comfortable, regardless ofwhether you rely on “one-on-ones,” email, voicemail updates, orstanding meetings. Pay attention to the frequency, volume, and duration of your com- munication. Pace matters. Be cautious that you don’t drive yourpeople so hard that they fatigue and become less effective. (And thisapplies to you, the leader, also! Go to the gym, garden, whateverhelps you stay balanced, and do it regularly to mentally reboot.)Operating for extended periods at just a few percentage points overtheir capacity can leave people feeling overwhelmed and apprehen-sive about participating. Push hard, take a break and assess the pace,and then push hard again. If you observe that your direction and communication leave people energized and looking forward to meeting each new challenge, thenyou may have found a good pace. Still, remember that a good pacefor the team might be too fast for some individual members of thatteam, depending on what other responsibilities they have. Stayattuned to pacing at the individual level as well as at the team level. === Page 103 === As We Lead 83Also pay special attention to what people are saying about the pro- cess, and don’t shy away from asking them how they feel. If and when the collaborative strategy process gets chaotic or con- fusing, remember to reorient people, manage expectations, and setcontext whenever the need arises. You will manage various phases of the methodology covered in detail in Part II. Keep that context in mind when checking on people’sresponse to pace. If you hear your people saying things such as “Idon’t know which way is up,” consider: •Investing the time to reorient them in whatever way seemsappropriate. It might",

Generally, acting as an “Official Process Guide” is easy if you maintaina clear view of the big picture and where you all are in the thick of it.Remember to communicate it early and often so others know it, too. You can give your people a sense of security by making it clear that it’s your responsibility to guide them forward. This will help indi-vidual team members be open to stepping outside of their comfortzones and taking risks that might pay off further down the road. Keep people in the loop and let them know what else is going on. Feel free to send quick one-liner emails, or use microblogging tools to letthe team know that things are on track. It’s a great idea to send a quicknote when someone on the team has gained a useful insight; forexample, “Joelle just did 30 phone calls with customers and learnedthat the key reason why advertisers are using our competitor is xyz.” Celebrate milestones. It’s simple yet powerful to send a message or “tweet” when you accomplish something, even something small. Youcan even celebrate team learning. Collaborative strategy creation can,at times, be a challenging back-and-forth process, so help your teamcoalesce and stay aligned by helping them create meaning around === Page 104 === Chapter 3 84what they are doing. If your team has just finished deciding some- thing they deem important to the company, celebrate it. Celebratethe fact that your team has declared, “This really matters to us.” Helpyour team manage perspective by seeing that they belong to some-thing larger than themselves, and that as a group they are contrib-uting to something greater. What you punctuate with your actionsand language indicates what is important to you and will be noticed. When you invest in managing team perspective, you help people stay in motion. This keeps the overall momentum up, and when peoplesense they are in motion, they are far more likely to continue puttingin the effort to make progress. 2.

When you perform thisassignment, you’ll often find yourself generating ideas as you createnew connections, as well as reinvigorating existing connections. Youwill use these interactions to create fresh opportunities that allowideas to bubble to the surface, expand, and even pop. New ideas and solutions to present-day problems rarely fall out of a cloudless blue sky. What typically precipitates a new idea is a shift inthinking prompted by the tension between competing ideas, or thepressure of an unexpected challenge in a tight timeframe. Sometimesnew technologies can spark that shift in thinking. Another richsource of opportunities comes from talking to others about specificimprovements, especially if the improvements are driven by outsidemarket forces. Conducting brainstorming sessions can also be a goodsource of concept sparks. Such sessions have the added value ofhelping people to explore the natural tensions that create frictionbetween opposing ideas. Sometimes ideas come back from groups and they are counterintuitive to a leader’s experience or wishes. When that happens, you get totake them on then and there, rather than have that perspectivehidden within the hearts and minds of people. Idea generation withthe spark of debate leads to shaping each other’s ideas, but it also can === Page 105 === As We Lead 85be about explaining why something really won’t work. It doesn’t mean that a leader has to succumb to the mass democratic nature ofthe people generating ideas. Collaboration is not meant to be ademocracy, but rather a meritocracy or a benevolent dictatorship inwhich the larger good of the company is achieved. Ask your people to find ways to clear their minds and inspire new thinking, such as listening to an insightful industry speaker, huntingdown interesting blogs, or watching a TED talk. 2In each case, the topic may be only peripherally related to work. You might share aradical new concept and push the group to “prove you wrong,” justto stir things up and give them practice at convincing you of whatthey believe. It also lets them see that you don’t expect everthing yousay to be treated as gospel. Frequently challenge assumptions. Question the way things are. How did the status quo become the status quo? Probe and challenge in sit-uations where your team can learn that doing so is accepted andvalid. Make sure your team is fully supported as they come up withthe best ideas possible to solve your particular strategy problem. People will share their ideas most effectively in",

Nurture Safe Culture Leading collaborative strategy requires nurturing a culture in whichpeople feel safe, so that you lower the sense of risk people feel as theybegin to work together to invent new solutions. A simple reality ofcollaboration is that people can’t create together if they don’t trusteach other. Some people find that team-building activities let them get acquainted, begin establishing a sense of trust, and have conflict-freeconversations before the pressure of schedules, budgets, and con-flicting interests enter the picture. Once your people feel safe enoughto risk expressing their precious ideas, you must encourage everyoneto bring their best selves and creative ideas to the table. Your job isnot to control this, but to facilitate it (Figure 3-5). === Page 106 === Chapter 3 86To create the space for people to express their opinions without fear of ridicule or condemnation, you must temper your own criticismand that of others. Insist that criticism is given constructively so thatit pushes the conversation forward and advances learning. In a larger sense, your job involves welcoming and accepting contra- dictory voices. Although there is an appropriate time to critique anddiscard weak ideas (as we will highlight in the process framework),most organizations have a number of team members that are adept at“stone throwing.” We need to get all the ideas out in order to dis-cover the good ones, and that is not as easily done if people are afraidof getting stones thrown at their ideas. Ask that people express theiropinions and ideas so that they build on the ideas of others rather thanchip away at them. A great example of this happens in improv theaterwhere participants learn to say “yes, and” instead of “no, but.” Thistechnique keeps the conversation moving forward. Both Google andWhole Foods offer their people classes in improv to teach them howto apply these kinds of techniques in business. 3 The story of Hans Grande in the sidebar “Profile of a CollaborativeLeader” on page 87 provides a memorable example from my ownexperience of someone who was extraordinarily successful inbuilding a culture where people felt comfortable collaborating.Figure 3-5.

Hans’s reputation, smarts, and ability to catalyze con-versations, coupled with his deep domain knowledge, led to his beinghandpicked by the then-COO of Adobe to support the integrationeffort. The COO didn’t ask Hans to formally lead the team. He askedHans to fill another pivotal role: that of bridging the cultural gap. The formal leaders understood that they required someone with the skills and permission to foster a culture of safety from day one. Theyalso understood that this responsibility did not have to rest directly onthe leaders themselves. By all accounts, Hans was an excellent choice.He held an MBA from the Haas School of Business and had been arespected team member on many high-visibility projects within Adobe. Most mergers do not achieve their predicted goals, aand the integration effort between Adobe and Macromedia did not look easy. The compa- nies had radically different cultures. Basic values and beliefs about howto get things done were dissimilar. Adobe people tended to use process-oriented language, whereas folks at Macromedia used a results-orientedstyle. The more “refined” Adobe people saw Macromedia people as“unruly cowboys” who made up rules as they went along. And Macro-media employees thought of the Adobe people as “stuck-in-the-mudbureaucrats.” Hans was perfect for this culture-setting role because he was likeable, whip-smart, and well respected. Hans would walk up to a relativestranger in the corporate integration room and say something like,“Wanna grab a slice of pizza and talk about X?” (whatever the issue athand happened to be) or “Any interest in checking out the new bowlingalley?” Hans would act as a catalyst by inviting those who needed to work together to play together. Typically he wouldn’t mention that you werenot the only person he’d invited. Then, at the pizza joint, the bowlingalley, or the coffee shop, Hans brought together people who didn’tknow each other (and maybe didn’t even see a reason to) and used a funsetting to build relationships and get better work done. —continued— === Page 108 === Chapter 3 88Fundamentally, Hans helped Adobe and Macromedia create the safe space that people needed in order to make important trade-offs andwork together on the toughest of issues. His ability to make connectionsand foster a context of play outside of the formal integration protocolsor pressure of the boardroom was vital to making the integration work.The “whitespace” interactions allowed team members to see the human-ity behind cultural stereotypes and to develop",

Hans did not try to script out in advance how he was going to get people to agree on a given topic. He didn’t try to get them to sign up for or com-mit to something they might be hesitant to do. Hans understood thatproblem solving would go more smoothly if the participants had somecommon ground, and that if their only interactions were in an adversar-ial context, the integration would be doomed. So Hans first focused oncreating situations for finding that common ground that would enablepeople to approach touchy topics as partners instead of competitors. Remarkably, Hans was not a “softie.” People on both sides regarded him as a knowledgeable and respected “quant-jock.” Hans could slice-and-dice quantitative data with the best of them. But he didn’t approachstrategy issues with just his intellect, and the merger was a case in point.Hans’s unusual combination of strengths (emotional resonance, intel-lectual prowess, natural intuition) was key to his success. His analyticalability gave him “street cred” among the hardcore rationalist leaders,which bought him the permission to use his gift for creating a safe spacefor people from both companies to get acquainted and break down stereo-types before attempting “productive” conversations. By creating thiskind of culture and shared framework first, Hans got people thinkingstrategically and working together collaboratively. b aSource for merger statistics: http://blogs.computerworld.com/node/255. Fifty-eight per- cent of mergers failed to reach the value goals set by top management. (1999 A.T.Kear- ney study of 115 transactions cited in the book After the Merger, published by Pearson.) Fifty-three percent of mergers failed to deliver their expected results. (2001 Booz Allen &Hamilton study of 78 deals.) Seventy percent of mergers failed to achieve expected reve-nue synergies. Twenty-five percent of merger execs overestimated the cost savings by atleast 25%. bHans Grande was an incredibly humble guy who would have protested my honoringhim in public like this. He passed away shortly after the integration effort. I share hisstory because he believed, like I do, that the way we work together matters and helps uscreate value.

Developing connections acrossboundaries—across corporate silos, divisions, functions, depart-ments, and teams—is at the heart of building a truly productive andcollaborative environment. 4. Develop Connections Developing connections is about bridging divides, large and small.When working on this assignment to assemble the right group ofpeople to tackle an issue, you will be linking departments, divi-sions, and individuals across the organization in new and sometimesunexpected ways. You will use your understanding of how differentparts of your organization operate, and you’ll encourage conversa-tions across the invisible boundaries that might have kept peoplefrom working together in the past. As you compose any team, think about individual personality types and styles. Whether you rely on systems such as Myers-Briggs, colors,or the Enneagram, or you use your own “spidey-sense” intuition,keep in mind that certain styles can be quite compatible or incompat-ible, and that “compatible” may not mean “similar.” Do what you can to encourage that every connection is a kind of cre- ative partnership. However, if a specific connection doesn’t click, trybuilding a connection with a different person, one where there’sbetter chemistry between people. As you build each connection, carefully think through the choices you are making and how it will impact the team, because it willdetermine who’s at the table and who needs to play what role. By fig-uring out who specifically needs to engage and by catalyzing the rightconnections, you will help different parts of the organization cometogether and work on the problem at hand. Developing connections is particularly important because addressing the toughest challenges in business requires getting the rightpeople to work together in alignment with a shared vision of success. === Page 110 === Chapter 3 90And connecting people across organizational boundaries lets you leverage the company’s strengths, wherever they happen to be found. As you initiate connections, provide context of business issues to dis- cuss. Kindle each connection with the spark of a new idea to test thechemistry. New ideas provide the fuel and the energy to develop cre-ative new solutions to ever-changing problems. New ideas providethe power for collaborative strategy. One thing that everyone will want to know is when you have arrived at a destination. Please note that there are many destinations along the way to the end of a project. As simple as this",

When there is no checkered flag, how do youknow when you’re done? As a leader, you can clarify where the finishline is by influencing how and when decisions are made. In partic-ular, you can orient your team to recognize situations where seekingthe absolute best option is not justified. Quite often, it is more thanacceptable to achieve a milestone or result that is “good enough,”meaning it meets or exceeds the needs of the situation. This is theprocess of satisficing. 5. Satisfice The job of figuring out when done is done (or when you need to keeptrying) is a judgment call. When I discovered the concept of satis- ficing many years ago (in Scientific American, of all places), I found the word that describes the perfect stopping point. 4Satisficing is a decision-making strategy that uses criteria for adequacy rather thanperfection. It’s a concept that helps us know when we’re done. Satis-ficing is about defining when enough is enough and it’s time to moveon. It is a pragmatic alternative to maximizing, minimizing, or opti-mizing. When you engage this technique, you choose to stop onething and move on to another while managing to time and resourceconstraints. You help your team make the best decisions for the situ-ation at hand, knowing that you might need to make more decisionslater. Satisficing is the opposite of trying to achieve the “perfect” solution. As Voltaire said, “The perfect is the enemy of the good.” Whenyou’re balancing a dozen competing demands, there is no clear === Page 111 === As We Lead 91notion of “perfect,” so seeking it does not add value. Other times, investing in some element makes no difference to the larger out-come. Does your website need a custom feedback form? Or is anemail address enough? Would travelers choose Southwest more oftenif it served almonds and cashews, or are they really driven by lowfares and on-time arrivals? Satisficing is about helping your peoplerecognize they’ve succeeded given the scope of what you wereworking on (Figure 3-6). Sometimes peanuts are a perfectly accept-able answer. 6. Engage Issues When you engage the issues, you lead the simple act of gettingpeople to talk. You pose questions such as: What will it take us toaddress this problem?

Engaging the issues is an act of bravery because you demonstrate the ability to deal with issues head-on. Engaging the issues does not meanhaving the answers, but it does mean being committed to learning. Forexample, where someone says X is the most important problem andanother says the most critical issue is Y, the question to ask is: how canboth be true? It is possible you will learn that X is most important tocustomers and Y is most important to finance (or operations, orchannel partners). By engaging the issues, you create the opportunityto learn what the organization is willing to do in more detail.Figure 3-6. Satisficing is knowing when enough is enough === Page 112 === Chapter 3 92Engaging the issues accomplishes two things that can dramatically shape culture. It allows you to: •Communicate to the people working around you that you value openness and risk taking. •Lead by example, showing your people they can acknowledgethe truth and talk about it. People at all levels actually want to be able to understand the issues, they want to be able to talk about what is really going on, and theywant to do it without fear. By engaging the issues, you lead this effort, giving others permission to speak to what they see, ask questions, and contribute freely. Bychoosing to engage the issues, you shed light into dark corners andtake the discussions in your company to a higher level. You also dif-fuse pent-up concerns that something important is being ignored. Most people don’t see how conflict can serve business. They think appeasing everyone createspeace, but that just waters down solutions. It isour ability to work through tension that resolves issues and creates new solutions. In general, people tend to shy away from engaging the issues in an effort to protect themselves. They fear difficult conversations, and theywant to avoid feeling uncomfortable, incompetent, unsuccessful, orblamed. They don’t want to be perceived as causing conflict. Whena culture lacks a pattern of dealing cleanly and fairly with tensionand conflicting viewpoints, those natural avoidance behaviors areunderstandable. Not healthy, but understandable. However, engaging the issues does not mean blame, judgment, or conflict. It does mean having conversations about present andfuture risks, such as customers defecting, competition winning, ormarkets disappearing. We have these",

Avoid getting personal, and keep the dis-cussion focused on the business impact. For example, don’t say,“What Kristine did is causing a lot of pain.” Instead, you might say,“This situation is impacting us a lot. What would it actually cost usto solve the problem?” Often problems arise through reasonable actions, and it can sometimes help to acknowledge this: “It seems that in the rush to meet our lastmilestone, we took some shortcuts. That’s understandable, but as oftenhappens, some of the shortcuts have caused a problem, and we need todeal with it. Do we have the capacity to solve this problem now? Whatwould be the impact of waiting six months?” By showing theimpact and asking questions with room for choice, you empoweryour colleagues to decide how best to move forward. By engaging the issues and opening up a dialogue, you enable yourcompany to begin talking about key decision points. It is not neces-sary to get commitment about solving a problem, only to get the con-versation going, so that it can be solved at some point in time. Insome situations, you may find that a group’s decision to postponedealing with a particular problem can be the absolute right decision,if, for example, there is a larger issue that needs addressing first. Ifyou find yourself unable to deal with conflict and you avoid it to thedetriment of yourself or your business, figure out the underlyingreason and resolve it by participating in the Hoffman Program refer-enced in Appendix B. To make it easier to engage the issues, here are some helpful hints: •Take other people’s perspectives into account, and speak as though you are peers. Refer to Appendix B for resources on howto speak the truth with clarity and power. •How do you tell a powerful leader that you think he is missingsomething? The answer is to get inside his mind and see throughhis eyes. This can sound like: “It seems like we’re doing A, B,and Cbecause we’re assuming X, Y, and Z are going to happen.But there’s a real chance that Y will not turn out quite the waywe’re anticipating. We might be better off doing D, E, and Finstead. Can we talk about that?” The more articulate and specific ===",

The curious thing about dealingwith the issues is that people often want to go off into the weeds.Tangential topics can pop up, and people will get uncomfort-able and want to change the subject. People often want to defendtheir actions, even when no one is targeting them. They may feelanxiety and implicit blame. You can defuse much of that anxietyby taking a brief moment to acknowledge that the current situa-tion may very well have arisen from legitimate and reasonableefforts. Make the point that the discussion at hand is focused onmoving forward, not looking backward. •Name your intent (and keep reinforcing it if you need to). Itoften helps people to accept your involvement when you tellthem why you are involved and what your interests are. It’s alsohelpful to tie the topic to what the person, company, division, orteam wants. When asked to research an issue, it’s useful to share with everyone involved that your purpose is not to find the flawaround what’s not working (and to blame), but to help the teamfind out what to do next and regain its success. •Be open about your own mistakes and culpability (if they exist).Be up front about your past contributions to the situation, if any,and focus the conversation on the present and the future. Showyour humanity and lead by example. Don’t leave it to others totell you that the emperor has no clothes. •Stay focused on simply engaging with the issues versus finding aspecific outcome. When well-intentioned people engage on atopic, they will often uncover misunderstandings, and it maytake some time to find a resolution. The less attached you are toa particular outcome, the more you can simply focus on gettingpeople to start talking and making progress. •Engage a professional facilitator or someone from elsewhere inthe firm (like Hans Grande) if you personally expect to be anactive participant in the discussion. A facilitator will be able tohelp you by tracking and managing the rational, emotional, andintuitive parts of the discussion. This will leave you free to par-ticipate fully in the conversation. === Page 115 === As We Lead 95•Be open to learning. You will likely find out something you don’t yet know or don’t want to see.

Whenever you are involved, engage the issues ina healthy way. I’ve had executives watch an aggressive power playhappen right in front of them and say, “I’ll let you two work it out.”That rarely works; instead, it signals that it’s OK to do power playswithin the organization. If you let power games go unchecked, youare setting up a catastrophic failure in your business. You may notwant to choose sides, but you can strongly urge that the merits of theissue get addressed instead of allowing the issue to become political. Keep power games and passive-aggressive behavior in check. If you let them go unchecked, you end up letting people work from posi-tional power, which undermines the power of good ideas. It endsonly when we say that it’s not OK to work from positional power. Toget from us-versus-them to a collaborative culture, that stuff is nolonger allowed (see Figure 3-7). Our cultural norm going forward is about having each of us co-create our future, defining together what we want to build for our teams,divisions, or companies. So we need to start demanding that people focus on the problem and get on the same side of the table to do it. Figure 3-7.

Are you taking that approach because you don’thave a good cost-benefit argument for your position?” works won-ders to get people to cut it out.) And if you tend to hush up issues asa way to avoid conflict, just know that you are missing out on oppor-tunities to learn. Conflict is a signal that there may be an opportunity toimprove on the status quo. Until some shift happens (like learning anew fact or point of view), change and growth never can. When creating strategy, maintaining forward progress is essential to overall success; satisficing supports this.

On the one hand, they were under pressure to implementsome near-term changes to reduce costs. On the other hand, theywanted time to think through longer-term product assortment issues,i.e., which products are sold by which channel. The key was to figure out what issues needed to get resolved immedi- ately while simultaneously leaving the door open wide enough tochange the product assortment in case the product team later arrivedat another conclusion. In this case, sequencing the conversation, workflow, and decisions meant that the sales team could begin talking to the channel partnersto make short-term decisions they needed to act on.

Figuring out what needs tohappen at what point will give people a sense of what is on the horizon,so they have enough time to learn and reflect and act with grace. Be a Collaborative Leader These seven responsibilities and their corresponding assignments—managing cadence, generating ideas, nurturing a safe culture, devel-oping connections, satisficing, engaging the issues, and tracing thetopography of the conversation, workflow, and decisions—are task-independent. Meaning that, when you do them, you are leading co-creators, not just a leader of any particular effort to solve a problem.

We are ready to apply what we’ve covered in apractical, roll-up-your-sleeves-and-get-dirty kind of way. So let’s now turn our attention toward putting all of this into prac- tice. Let’s explore how leaders and individuals can take their newunderstanding of roles and responsibilities and apply it to the phasesof the collaborative strategy process. That’s next. === Page 121 === PART II II.The QuEST Process for Collaborative Strategy We started this book with the notion that we need to change how business works. If business is to thrive, institutions must move from an us-versus-them opposition to an us-versus-opportunity stance. Bydoing strategy creation collaboratively, we are demanding that eachof us take responsibility for the shared outcome, to improve busi-ness performance. We will move fast, get aligned, and welcome thecreative conflict as we work together. Part I, which we’ve just finished, covered how we need to show up at work to enable the creative and productive act of collaborativestrategy. We focused on the role each of us has, and what we need todo as leaders. We’re about to enter Part II, which covers the actions we need to take to reach the needed outcome. There are four stages of collabora-tion: Question, Envision, Select, and Take, or QuEST. These stagesare shared in the four chapters that follow. First up is “Question,” which focuses on seeing the full picture of what needs to be solved. We’ll learn a process for making sure theproblem we have identified is the right problem, as well as getting aclear picture of “what is true,” so we have a solid basis for how to getfrom where we are to the future we decide we want. The most cru-cial aspect of this phase is getting early organizational understandingof the problem. === Page 122 === Part II 102The second phase is “Envision,” where the emphasis is on creating options from a full marketplace of ideas within the organization. Toknow which options should matter more, we start to capture the cri-teria that come up, which will later shape",

Next, and perhaps most important, we enter the “Select” phase. This forces us to make the tough choices that business absolutely needs tomake, to avoid the malaise caused by the perpetually repeated asser-tion that “we’ll do everything and do it all well.” Last, we “Take” to create accountability in the system. “Take” means taking ownership, taking responsibility, and taking charge. These four phases form the QuEST collaborative strategy framework (Figure II-1). You can get a quick sense of the framework by understanding the specific goal of each phase within the process, together with theapproximate duration of each phase (Table II-1). Figure II-1. QuEST collaborative strategy framework overview === Page 123 === The QuEST Process for Collaborative Strategy 103TABLE II-1. Collaborative strategy process framework (QuEST) PHASE/PHASE GOAL PHASE DURATION/COMMENTS 1. Question: Know what you need to knowMedium: 1–10 weeks The key here is to avoid shortcuts, and to rigorously collect all relevant informa-tion to enable a clear, deep, and richunderstanding of the need or opportu-nity you seek to address.The duration depends on the size ofyour scope, people’s availability to dis-cuss things, the priority within yourorganization, and the complexity of theissue. Cap at 10 weeks or less, sinceenergy fades after that point. 2. Envision: Create options that matter to this organization, at thistime and placeShort or long, depending on scope(typically 1–6 weeks) This creative phase focuses on the gen- eration of strategic ideas from every-where in the organization to find viableoptions, and the reasoning behind whythose options matter.The duration depends on the geogra-phies involved and how many disci-plines and teams need to discussoptions. 3. Select: Make tough choices Short The goal of this phase is to use the orig-inal MurderBoarding process (describedin Chapter 6) to sort ideas, and then fix,merge, tune, and toss them until onefinal winning strategy remains.Typically 1 day, but can be from 1 dayto several days. 4. Take: Create accountability Short The goal of this phase is to specify, with as much fidelity as possible, the follow-ing details of the final strategy: who isresponsible, the actions required to exe-cute the strategy, the changes neededto enable the strategy, and the meansof detecting how well the strategy is hit-ting the intended target.Typically 1 day, but can be from 1 dayto several days.

Each of the phases is collaborative in nature, but indifferent ways. The Question phase is about fully shared under-standing of the problem, and so it depends upon all participantsexpressing their perspectives on the challenge. The Envision phase usescollaborative creativity to develop a pool of ideas for later selection.The Select phase pushes for explicit agreement (not tacit acceptance)on the choice of strategy option, and collaboration is essential forthat. The Take phase is about working together to build a unifiedand detailed plan of action. Before proceeding to the specifics of each phase, take a moment to consider the mindset you’ll need when using this process framework.Creating great strategy requires multiconversational, multidimensionaldiscovery that involves three ongoing tasks: learning about what isrelevant, defining what matters, and determining what the organiza-tion needs to do to make something new happen. As such, newinformation and new insights will sometimes mean you have torevisit previous phases so that your decisions can be aligned with thenew information. This potentially nonlinear aspect of strategy creation can seem messy, but this messiness is a byproduct of thoroughness, whichalways pays off in the final execution of a strategy (Figure II-2). Figure II-2. Strategy creation is a controlled messy process === Page 125 === The QuEST Process for Collaborative Strategy 105The process framework helps you be explicit and informed about the choices you are making so you can move forward quickly. When the process feels messy, that’s OK. Not only is it OK, it needs to be messy. Creating something new is almost never neat. The good news is that when you dig deep early, your team can discover poten-tial obstacles that might otherwise have remained hidden duringstrategy creation. Digging deep is essential to preventing the AirSandwich. Your willingness to let the process be messy from time to time increases the chances of finding a strategy that will work, as well asdiscovering when a strategy won’t work. Both discoveries are valu-able when making decisions about where to spend valuableresources. By following the QuEST process framework, you make sure that: •You have unearthed the real problem in such a way that every- one sees it clearly. •Your team can generate many options, but still make tough deci-sions quickly. •The people who implement the final strategy understand the fun-",

Ultimately, everyone involved will have an internalized under-standing of why the strategy is important and what it is designed todo to serve the end goal of winning. They will not be just the “doers”but also “thinkers” who serve the organization. After we finish Part II, we’ll step back into the larger view of the orga- nizational rules of engagement to establish the new QuEST stan-dards in an organization. That’s what Part III will detail. For now, we need to dive deep into Part II. This methodology builds on the foundation of the “ways of being” covered in Part I. So let’sget into the specific phases. === Page 127 === Chapter 4CHAPTER 4 Phase I: Question It is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail. —Abraham Maslow Know What We Need to Ask and Answer Isn’t it tempting to do what we’ve already done because it’s the road we know? It is for me. The next section we’re taking on is the “how”of creating better business outcomes. Above the inside door of my office, there’s an Italian clock, and above that, there’s a little sign printed on regular laser printer paper.It reads “All Roads Lead to Rome.” My team gave it to me after anarduous time helping an e-commerce company hit their $24Mproduct launch goal. The phrase had become the mantra for the lastfew weeks. “All Roads Lead to Rome” was what we kept repeating toour client (and to ourselves) to focus everyone on the process ratherthan fixating on getting to a specific answer, so we could create astrategy together that would actually work. You lovers of history may recognize the phrase. I learned it during a college course in Western Civilization. The Roman Empire, youmight remember, drove the greatest economic expansion in history—connecting remote places and people together through commerce.One way it did this was by building a vast network of roadsconnecting widespread communities so that Roman legions could === Page 128 === Chapter 4 108deploy and harness resources wherever needed. The city of Rome was effectively the center and genesis of their universe, so the Empirebuilt its roads from that place, outward. If you were somewhere",

This analogy comes in handy when a team loses its way and is wan- dering through the vast confusion of strategy creation, lost betweenthe goal and all the data, various perspectives, and too many options.“All Roads Lead to Rome” is a phrase that can remind you to followand trust that the resilience of the process will deliver you to yourdestination—that is, to the winning, workable strategy. At another level, the phrase reminds you that most of the time people already have the wisdom and the knowledge required to get wherethey need to go; the trouble is that the key ideas may be scattered farand wide throughout the organization in the minds of various doersand functional leaders or in the larger ecosystem. Of course, the approach the Romans took worked for the Roman Empire. Other empires have relied on different ways to connectremote places and people. Similarly, creating strategy relies on a pro-cess, but not just any process. The notion that “All Roads Lead toRome” depends on having a process for creating strategy in a collab-orative way: a process that’s flexible yet robust, and has been testedenough so that you can place your faith in it to give you businessresults. The key for building great strategy is to figure out the way to con- nect seemingly disparate parts together so that something resultsfrom it and you “get there.” So how do we do this? And how do wedo this collaboratively so that what is decided gets made into areality? Let’s get down to business and explore the meat-and-potatoes steps of creating strategies using the QuEST process framework. What fol- lows are the details behind each phase: Question, Envision, Select, and Take. The QuEST process framework will guide you through a struc-tured, directed way of developing better business outcomes. === Page 129 === Phase I: Question 109You will learn the actions, steps, and responsibilities to execute each phase. I’ll also highlight some issues, which I call temptations, that youwill want to watch out for as you move through the strategy creationprocess.

I call it a framework, and not a methodology, because the structure is generic and is flexible enough to be applied to different applicationsin different contexts, meaning different industries, businesses, kindsof companies, and business units. The process framework is flexible because, even though the phases take place in a given order, at the end of one phase (and the begin-ning of another) there is a “gate” you have to pass through. Beforeyou get to a gate, the process framework recognizes that a learningloop happens inside each phase. And it’s not so rigid to suggest thatyou always follow an inflexible series of process steps, because theact of strategy creation involves people learning and formulatingideas. Creative processes are not linear, and nor are they purely ana-lytic. Much like life itself, there’s a flow to it. Strategy creation isunfortunately much messier than an “A to B to C” kind of model.Instead, the New How provides a framework of sequenced phases soyou know what particular things you want to accomplish, and in whatorder, to optimize business outcomes. And, as you exit a particularphase, it’s important to make sure certain things have been completed.That’s the role of each gate. The QuEST process framework allows you to create strategies in a way that is structured but fluid, messy but controlled, fast but delib-erate. It addresses many common concerns you might have along theway. You might shy away from creating strategy with other peoplebecause you fear that involving others will slow you down. However,the QuEST process framework allows you to keep things moving byinvolving people for specific reasons so that you can make decisionsthat roll forward and continue building on each other. === Page 130 === Chapter 4 110Remember the idea of satisficing from Chapter 3? It applies right here. Keeping things moving will force you to define when enough isenough, when it’s time to move on, and when you can stop one thingand start another. It’s the opposite of trying to get things 100% rightand achieve the “perfect” solution. The QuEST process frameworkallows for satisficing, which is essential to the larger success becauseit lets you keep going and continue making progress. This process framework also allows you to have a certain cadence of conversations that leads to timely decisions, so",

It lets them knowwhat is coming next and what they’ll need to do to prepare for thenext thing. Most importantly, QuEST accommodates the messinessof strategy creation, given that it is a creative act and one that’salmost never neat and tidy. It helps you to make the messy choices ina conscious and engaged way. The QuEST process framework is built on four repeatable core phases that focus your team on the essential decisions you need tomake by the end of each phase. The process framework helps youturn business opportunities into visions, visions into strategies, andstrategies into specific and measurable plans of action. It leads youthrough a set of steps that allow you to clarify the problem as a team,figure out what success looks like, ask and answer the right ques-tions, generate ideas, sort ideas until you arrive at one final beststrategy, and then create clarity and accountability for what needs tohappen. The Question Phase: How It Fits The first phase of the QuEST process framework is the Questionphase (Figure 4-1). During this phase, you build a rich under-standing of the situation you are facing by asking and answering theright questions. It precedes the Envision phase because you need toknow what the problem is and have everyone understand whatyou’re trying to accomplish. The Question phase is done before the Select phase because you need to be clear on the problem scope (which I’ll discuss in the next section), so the resulting strategy will matchthe problem. === Page 131 === Phase I: Question 111Working Parts of the Question Phase The Question phase is about making sure you understand the problem with enough fidelity, gather all the facts you need to get aclear picture of where you are today, and organize and share theresults of the fact-finding to build understanding of and agreementon the problem being solved. The Question phase is about going in with an open mind, so everyone is open to new information, insights, and directions. Itrequires stepping into the initial discussion of the problem in an inquisi-tive way to look at what the problem actually is, and to gather all therelevant information necessary to understand what needs to be solved. There are three steps to the Question phase: identifying the problem, gathering relevant information, and sharing the findings to make surethe problem being solved is well understood. Let’s talk",

Step 1: Identifying the Problem Scope How many times have you jumped straight to the resolution of aproblem, only to realize later that if you had been more thoughtful andasked more questions first, you could have come up with a far bettersolution? This preliminary step in the Question phase, then, is aboutdeciding that a particular problem needs to be solved, a difficult issueneeds to be tackled, or a new challenge needs to be confronted.Figure 4-1. Question is the first phase of QuEST === Page 132 === Chapter 4 112For the purposes of our discussion, I’ll be using the word problem as shorthand, even though some people perceive problem to be a nega- tive word. Think of it as a way to talk about the gap between where you are today and where you want to be. I could just as easily call it“opportunity,” so if it helps you, you can mentally substitute thatword. Once you’ve identified and clarified the difference betweenwhat you have and what you want, you have defined a problem. And this is the point at which you can begin to develop yourthinking and start to engage the organization to work toward asolution collaboratively. Establishing the problem scope is identifying what you intend to work on or believe needs to be tackled. Note that I use the words “intend” and “believe.” What I’m pointing to is not a definitive “this istheproblem,” but rather the problem scope is a hypothesis to be tested. It’s not about “following your gut” and jumping to a conclu-sion (Figure 4-2), although the problem scope will surely be shapedby your gut or intuition. It’s about identifying the right people toinvolve, or the characteristic of the right people, similar to the waythat Adobe chose Hans because of his natural gifts (see “Profile of aCollaborative Leader” on page 87). Perhaps even more importantly,it’s about setting the stage to create a solution by clarifying theunderlying nature of the problem, which lets you develop an earlyunderstanding of what you, your organization, and your companyare up against. Because strategy is never a theoretically perfect solu-tion, but rather the solution that would most likely work given yourcontext, competitive situation, capabilities, and so on, the problemscope needs to take into account the lay of the land.

You are defining the shape, size, and perimeters of the problem you want to take on.Just like you might architect a house to be a “3,000-square-footCraftsman on a hilly property,” you would architect a businessproblem to be “enterprise-customer-focused in the North Americaregion affecting product line X.” To know what we are building, weneed some architecture of what it generally looks and feels like. Thisis because encountering new problems—and beginning to thinkabout solving them—is unavoidable. It’s the natural result of havingsolved other problems earlier. === Page 133 === Phase I: Question 113The problem architecture is about characterizing the problem, get- ting a handle on the parameters of it, and then naming it. Getting tothe essence requires that you stay open to the size, scope, basicnature, and even the name of the problem itself. It’s about clarifyingwho’s involved and what they care about. It also includes identifyingwhat’s stopping or preventing the problem from being solved now.But more than anything, defining the problem architecture revolvesaround trying to connect what appears to be the problem with what the problem actually is…to the even more important thing that people are trying to solve. The fact is, most complex business problems are not clear-cut, meaning there is no obvious right or wrong answer. It’s almostalways about data gaps, human issues, understandings or misunder-standings, and gaps between what is and what needs to be. Theproblem architecture step includes both facts and data, as well asmaking sure you understand the human side of the business problemso you ultimately solve the full problem in such a way that it’ll stickto the organization and accomplish something. It’s essential to determine the problem scope as the first step in the Question process phase because everything that follows depends on it.Figure 4-2. Problem architecture shapes the scope === Page 134 === Chapter 4 114Without it, things don’t line up. When everything does line up, people can make conscious choices about how they’re going to bound the problem well enough to start building the team, confirm the scope,and, ultimately, develop the strategy to attack it. Defining the scope of the problem necessitates embarking on a small discovery process. To do this, you may want to engage in discussionswith your peers, talk to a few key people who are close to the problem,and/or have a discussion with your boss about possible new angles andquestions such as: “What do we really need to do",

Aim high, but not so high that you lose sight of what you areactually looking to achieve. When the focus is correct but not clear enough to act on, you’re on the right road and headed in the right direction. However, you’llneed to do some additional work to make sure the problem isbounded, but with a clear charter. Bounding the problem gives youthe scope: it says what’s in and what’s not. Table 4-1 lists some examples of statements that are directionally correct, and others that are properly bounded with a clear charter tocreate scope statements. TABLE 4-1.

Your job is to define a scope that is bounded by awell-formed outcome or tightly coupled set of outcomes.

Step 1: Problem scope roles and responsibilities LEADER’S ROLE •Define the scope. —Do an early discovery process. •Create a bounded problem statement. Possible boundary dimensions are time, market segment, divisions, product lines, and budget. •Create the space. —State the vision for the project. —Select the team. Remember that you can have a core strategy team drive the majority of the process and an extended team that must be engaged in some way. —Identify individuals needed on the team and specify why. —Set ground rules for interacting and collaborating. You can leverage Chapter 2 for this. —Review the QuEST process framework.—Talk about what to expect. COLLABORATOR’S ROLE •Question/challenge/debate the problem statement and clarify anything that doesn’t make sense. •Commit to co-creating a solution. •Participate actively (see Chapter 2). === Page 136 === Chapter 4 116•Why are we here? •What do we need to accomplish as a team? •Why does this matter? •How will we know when we are done? As simple as these questions seem, getting the team to articulate their answers is essential. Being clear about the answers at the outset willhelp team members know why they, specifically, are on the team andwhat you are trying to accomplish as a group. This preliminary kick-off meeting is the place to begin establishing a culture of safety, because it gives you ample opportunity to set theground rules for how you hope team members will interact, bothwith each other and with those who are not on the team. Gettingboth individual team members and the team as a whole to under-stand your role as leader and what you expect of them is anotherexcellent place to establish group norms. This meeting is also the right place to review the overall QuEST pro- cess framework, as well as the leader’s role, the collaborator’s role,and how all team members will be expected to engage during eachphase of the strategy creation effort. From here, you can move on to Step 2 in the Question phase: fact gathering.Managing Temptation: Being Overly Ambitious When you first identify the problem, you will find it tempting to assume that you already see the problem clearly, or, alternatively, to be overlyambitious about what you and your team can do. Resist these tempta-tions. All but the simplest business problems are complex in ways thatprevent people from easily seeing all angles",

You mayalso want to consider aiming for smaller goals with the assumption thatthe scope will probably expand once the team fully grasps the details ofthe situation. === Page 137 === Phase I: Question 117Step 2: Fact Gathering The second step of the Question phase, fact gathering, involves inter- viewing people throughout the organization (and possibly beyond—customers, partners, suppliers, etc.) to generate a deeper level ofunderstanding of your problem or opportunity. It is about exploringwhat questions you need to ask (and answer) to know your strategyproblem well enough to solve it. The goal of this step is to create a comprehensive picture of the problem, so that you can discuss and share it up front, eliminatingthe possibility of not being on the same page about the problem yourteam is solving, or worse, being out of sync with the reality of theactual problem. Fact gathering is not about proving your hypothesis.It is about learning/testing to see whether the hypothesis is accurate.Whatever you find while disproving or proving your hypothesis, youlearn something important. The fact gathering step of the Question phase is critical, as many people launch into solving a problem with incomplete data andtherefore an incomplete understanding of the problem they are tryingto solve. This step allows you to avoid this pitfall by getting you todefine four things: •What you know (and can prove) about the problem that youwant to solve •What you believe (but can’t prove) •What you doubt •What you suspect are outliers or “red herrings” (conflicting ormisleading “facts” that are not relevant) Also, fact gathering creates a forum for people to voice their hunches,questions, and concerns about doing something new early on in the strategy creation process. This lets you factor in nuances such as poli-tics and other important aspects of the situation and include them inthe ultimate solution you create. During fact gathering, you’ll learn what matters most to the organiza- tion and, therefore, what solution should you choose when it comesto selecting a strategy. So be sure to make special note and keep track === Page 138 === Chapter 4 118of what people say is important, because it will become part of your criteria for success and you’ll want to come back to it. We’ll talkmore about criteria for success in Chapters 5 and 6.

For the fact gathering step to achieve its goal, you and your team need to be “inquiry experts.” This means you need tostay open to what you don’t know, particularly if everyone on yourteam has significant expertise in the subject matter area of yourproblem, or if a good portion of the team has been in the organiza-tion for quite some time. It’s often the case that a group of experts orseasoned employees will be aware of topics and assume that everyoneunderstands them. To account for this, the fact gathering step must seek to reveal “two kinds of elephants” (Figure 4-3). The first is the elephant in the room. This is the big issue that almost everyone knows about but it’s a somewhat taboo topic, so no onebrings it up and the issue never gets addressed. Big, unaddressed “ele-phants” in your project can cause lots of trouble, so you definitely want Figure 4-3. Two kinds of elephants === Page 139 === Phase I: Question 119them revealed. If left unaddressed, big elephants can stampede around and cause trouble in your project, so get them out in the open. The second elephant is one that looks different from every perspec- tive: an important but multifaceted issue that many people see, buteach in only a limited way. We each have our own limited aperture—what we’re willing to look at or what we see. Sometimes our area ofresponsibility in the organization limits our perspectives. Other times, it’s a function of our own lack of understanding. If I were to put an elephant in the room you are in right now (and cut off your olfactory powers and blindfold you for a second) and haveyou touch it, I could have you describe what you felt and asksomeone sitting on the other side of the room to describe what theyfelt. As you both report it out, the two of you could appear to be inviolent opposition. The tail is going to feel different from the tusk;the toes are going to feel different from the back. So one of you isgoing to say, “It’s smooth,” while another says, “It’s hairy.” Both aretrue. Applying this to business, typically each of us sees only a part ofthe full picture because we work inside complex organizations. Thesilos that separate us can be huge. But it’s when",

This second elephant is about getting to a clarity or consensus about the nature of the problem. It’s only possible to understand the fullconcept of an elephant when you have more complete informationthan each individual point of view and when you add that informa-tion up. When important issues lack a joint understanding, they’lllead to problems down the road. But when everybody can look at thesame picture, together you can solve that problem. In order to successfully “reveal the elephants” in your project, it is important to adopt the right approach to the fact gathering step.People often come at the task asking simply, “What do we need toknow?” This seems logical, but putting a focus on answers can under- mine the Question step and put pressure on people to “find relevantdata” to “get it right.” Factual answers alone don’t encourage peopleto talk about the elephants that need revealing. A more effective approach is to put the focus on the kinds of ques- tions that people need to ask instead of the kinds of answers thatneed to be found. By way of example, here are sample questions that === Page 140 === Chapter 4 120might start a fact gathering session for a team that is strategizing on how to defend against a competitor: •What do we know about what has been done before? •Who has been involved? •What results did they generate? •What do we need to know about why this worked or didn’twork? By beginning with process questions, you’ll treat the fact gatheringstep more like a discovery process, and it helps you stay open to whatyou might find. Adopting a position of inquiry doesn’t take muchtime, but if you miss it, you can’t add it back later. Make sure tocommit to this step before moving on to the legwork of the fact gath-ering step: interviewing and researching. interviewing: mining wisdom. When you’re ready to begin fact gath- ering, you’ll want to interview people. This involves talking to peoplein your organization, and sometimes outside it, who are interactingwith some aspect of the problem. You will learn how they experi-ence the problem, so you can understand what they know about it.The process can be a bit like building a mosaic. Up close, things maylook random and unordered, but stepping back reveals the entire,clear picture. At the end of the process, when you’ve put",

You will know what has already been tried andhas failed in the organization, how people feel about the currentproblem, what they believe to be true, and what key data they thinkis central to consider. Interviewing is an efficient way to find sources of quantitative infor- mation, and it’s the best way to gather qualitative information; inother words, the kinds of perspective, knowledge, and insights—valuable nuggets of organizational wisdom—that help you makemeaning out of the data. It’s remarkable how often I see teams focus on numbers from formal reports and spreadsheets. They do this because they think numbers aremore concrete than qualitative (subjective) information. Perhaps itdoesn’t occur to them that quantitative information has its own kind === Page 141 === Phase I: Question 121of “fuzziness” and can be misleading for any number of reasons. Num- bers don’t provide the empirical set of facts we often think they do. Remember that, according to Benjamin Disraeli (and popularized by Mark Twain), “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, andstatistics.” This quote is well known because it’s so easy to manipu-late numbers so they say what you want them to say. That’s why it’sso important to gather the human intelligence as well. Mining wisdom requires that you recognize the need for a balance of both quantitative and qualitative information. Sure, quantitative datais critical. It’s the language of business. But keep in mind thatbecause numbers appear concrete, people tend to discount the “softstuff” during strategy creation, even though subjective information— such as insights about what’s most important in a given situation or what the organization is actually capable of—is just as crucial. In addition to being an important way of collecting data, knowledge, and insight, interviews offer the added bonus of helping you buildsupport for your strategy early in its creation. So, with that in mind,whom should you talk to? Pay attention to whom you ask. In the Question phase, whom you ask shapes what you learn. Many people only ask key questions of people at the very top of the organization, thinking that they must know more. Although the people at the top do hold important knowledge, be awarethat as information gets farther from its source, it is distilled, distorted,and stripped of its critical nuances.

To expand your list of interview candidates, ask your initial group of candidates to nominate three other people within the organization totalk to, and pay attention to names that get nominated multipletimes. These individuals can be a great resource, and they can oftennominate three other people to talk to. When the problem is a product that isn’t achieving revenue goals, talk to the salespeople who are missing their targets. Resist theimpulse to go only to the people who are achieving their quotas,because they have most likely found a way around existing obstacles, or === Page 142 === Chapter 4 122might never have encountered them in the first place. The people who are losing deals are much more likely to be aware of what needsto be fixed in the product (or channel, or sales operations) to achievegrowth. When finding out about lost deals, be sure to probe for otherfactors that may be influencing the problem, such as pricing or thesales exception process. For example, when you want to find the obstacles preventing the business from scaling, talk to the people handling customer servicecalls. Ask them what their customers complain about, becauseunsatisfied customers will tell you what’s not working and why theywon’t be buying the next whiz-bang gizmo. The people handlingthese calls hear these complaints every day, and they hear them first.Chances are, they’re keeping a list, and this list often contains theraw data of what is truly happening on the front lines. When the problem is to discover the next big opportunity, look out-side the company. Opinions inside the company typically are limitedand held down by “what can we do.” Instead, try talking to non-customers to find out what you might do. Ask partners, or devel-opers, or people who run industry associations about what they needand what problems they wish the company would solve. I know how important it is to dig in and keep digging. In my com- pany’s early years, we worked with an organization that was trying toreconcile the pricing of a product. The product management teamthought the price was too low, and the sales team thought the pricewas too high. Each team believed the other team’s view was self-serving and was therefore putting its revenue growth projections atrisk. Both teams had talked to customers and had gathered facts",

When we took the time to interview customers, we looked beyond the questions the teams had already asked, and kept digging to findsomething that would allow both sets of facts to be true. What wefound was that two distinct kinds of customers were using the sameproduct in two different ways. One customer group was willing topay a lot of money, whereas the other believed the product was over-priced. We brought these results back to the company, who shiftedtheir discussions from pricing to figuring out how to differentiate theproduct into two different product lines.

Interviewing techniques matter. For the fact gathering step to be as fruitful as possible, you’ll want to conduct your interviews carefully. Let’s review how interviewing fits into the Question phase. I’d like to highlight some suggestions that you’ll want to consider before youbegin the interviews. For deeper guidance on how to conduct inter-views well within your organization, check out the “Tips for Inter-viewing” section in Appendix A. First, conduct your interviews in person whenever possible, especially when dealing with complex problems (but don’t skip an intervieweeif the phone is the only practical option). Remember that most timesManaging Temptation: Sharing Sensitive Information When you’re doing fact gathering well, your interviewees will tend to open up and share all sorts of information. You may come across sensi-tive information or learn about situations that could compromise cer-tain departments, divisions, or people. You may be tempted to sharethis information and its source so that the situation can be brought tolight quickly. However, it is vital to handle the information you gatherwith 100% respect and sensitivity. In some cases, you can report find-ings, but don’t attach these findings to a name unless you have permis-sion. Sometimes even the information itself must be kept under wraps. For example, you may learn of an impending business deal or significant personnel change that is relevant to your strategy. In such cases, youmay or may not be able to include a small part of the team in this aware-ness. Without sharing the information, you may still be able to use it, butdoing so will require you to depend on your personal judgment",

In order to explain some of your decisions,you may need to disclose that you’ve received important confidentialinformation that is influencing you. The good news? These situations donot arise very often. Consciously manage the temptation to disclose sensitive information. In particular, you must never use any information you learn to under-mine someone. Maintaining confidentiality is important because itbuilds trust and supports your ability to do thorough fact gathering inthe future. === Page 144 === Chapter 4 124the business problem you’re investigating affects the people you are talking to, so what you learn from them matters to them. Talkingwith people face to face will give you insight into the factors influ-encing their input, as well as who the people are beyond just the rolethey play. Although some people might think this exercise is only forextroverts, in reality it can be done by every type of person. This isnot a social exchange; these interviews are about learning, and theprocess is about discovery. Knowing who the players are, what makes them tick, and what their deeper, underlying needs are will allow you to tailor the eventualstrategy so that it can take those needs into account if appropriateand ultimately achieve your goals. For a strategy to work, it has to meet the needs of the people who must support it. Interviewing opens the door to finding things that you may not evenknow you’re looking for. Questions pop up in the heart of a discus-sion that don’t arise when you’re sitting at your desk staring at ablank piece of paper. More often than not, the more unusual thequestion is, the better the discovery. If you find yourself wanting toask some unscripted question, do it. Crazy, off-the-wall questions inthe heat of the moment are a signal to your interviewee that this is awide-open conversation. This can take the interview to new place, or prompt the person being interviewed to recall something that she wasn’t aware she knew. I frequently ask, “If you were king/queen/ruler of the universe for a day, what one thing would you do/fix/change?” (see Figure 4-4). “Tell me what I need to know” comple-ments this. Although many people are comfortable with the concept of inter- viewing to gather data, knowledge, and insight, the idea of asking forhelp seems foreign. But asking for help during the Question phase can produce excellent results. Approach each interview as an oppor-tunity for partnership. Ask",

Ask them to share what they believe you ought to know. === Page 145 === Phase I: Question 125Ask them what matters most in this situation. Asking for help will open more doors than demanding information. When you ask peopleto help, they will often share the most vital information you need.Remember to tag the topics that matter most as potential success cri-teria for use in later phases. As mentioned earlier, one area where you might want to ask for help is in gaining access to quantitative data as good reference content. Ifyou do ask about this, try to do it toward the end of the interview.Asking for this kind of information too early may push the conversa-tion in a quantitative direction, causing you to miss the chance to learnabout the more subjective nuances, which are important. When you dotalk about data, be sure to ask basic critical questions and especiallyabout any caveats the data brings with it. Is there anything else youshould know about the data you’ll be gathering? For more on askinggood questions, see Appendix A. researching: gathering data you can reference. Quantitative, hard numbers from reports and databases are an important part of the Ques-tion phase, but use them with care. The ubiquity of computers andvastness of the Internet mean that quantitative information is every-where, and much of it is free and of dubious quality. Still, numbers canbe a gold mine, as long as you know how to interpret the data.Figure 4-4. Get people enrolled in the process === Page 146 === Chapter 4 126The first step in knowing how to interpret your information is knowing where it came from. If you identify that the 2008 consumer softwaretotal available market (TAM) was $X zillion, it matters where that datapoint was found. Were the numbers from a 2009 study? Or from a2007 projection? You may need to revisit the source of a “fact” in orderto evaluate the assumptions and vocabulary of the source. Keepingtrack of your information sources also increases the credibility of facts in discussions down the road. Beyond the source, try to get perspectives on the validity of the data. If you gained access to databases or reports during your interviews,hopefully you also got some sense of the accuracy and reliability ofthat data.

Two particular skills will be useful.Managing Temptation: Believing You Already Know What Problem Needs Solving As you start capturing facts and criteria, you and your team will be tempted to rush through the process because of the erroneous and all-too-common belief that you already know the essence of the problemand have nearly all the info you need to solve it. This belief is the resultof having been around the block often enough to think you know whatmatters. It’s particularly tempting because your gut sense about prob-lems like these may actually be very good indeed. Resist this temptation. In unexpected situations, it’s possible (even likely) that key stakeholders will call upon your team to verify that theyhave the right information, to ensure that decisions are, in fact, basedon real, verified data (or, when necessary, on unverified data that every-one agrees is unverified, and is therefore a calculated risk). In addition, although it’s tempting to shut people down when you’ve heard something two or three times before, there is value in having peo-ple in the organization express what you already know. You’ll get inde-pendent confirmation of what you know, and they’ll know that they’vebeen heard and are valued. === Page 147 === Phase I: Question 127First, if you have raw data, it will be very important to have someone with the ability to slice-and-dice numbers in search of insights.Second, you need someone who can “see through” and comment onconclusions drawn from statistics, particularly on information frompolling data. For example, was there a sampling bias? Did thewording of the question make it impossible to answer accurately?What did the analyst mean by “open systems”? The skills of aninsightful number cruncher can be very useful in this phase. Fact gathering: Roles and responsibilities As you’ll recall, each phase and step of the QuEST process frame-work relies on a set of unique activities. Accordingly, your role asleader and participant will by necessity vary somewhat, depending onthe point in the process.Managing Temptation: Choosing Certainty over Clarity Even though the fact gathering step may take only a week or two to complete, the tension of wanting to move fast and get to an answerquickly can tempt you to shortcut it.

This temptation can be especially strong when you’re working with internal groups who think they know enough about the situation and/or the organization to take a stab at defining the solution. The common mistake is to head straight to a quick-and-dirty sketch of the final picture without first gathering facts. The risk is that you end upwith a strategy that doesn’t deliver because the picture of the problemwas incomplete, and the resulting solution didn’t anticipate a majorobstacle or was misaligned with the hidden issues. Creating a quick-and-dirty picture isn’t unwise, necessarily, as long as you cycle back to thefact gathering step and carefully challenge the picture you’ve created. Making a habit of skipping this step entirely puts you in danger of miss- ing vital information when you actually need it. Doing fact gathering upfront, each time, ensures that you are working on the real issues and thereal problem. You know if you’re truly being diligent about the Ques-tion phase when you have the facts uncovered in some easily accessibleform. Without these facts, you cannot effectively challenge the under-standing you are creating. === Page 148 === Chapter 4 128Because some of what you’re responsible for might seem straight- forward and simple, you might be tempted to skip activities or ignorecertain responsibilities without realizing how painful the long-termconsequences could be. Moreover, as you lead, you will undoubt-edly be tempted to rely on clever, familiar techniques and shortcutsto keep people, activities, and the process moving along. After all,these skills and traits have helped you get this far, right? Why ditchthem now? We avoid taking shortcuts because the goal of capturing facts is to explore the scope of a given problem as fully and completely as pos-sible. The picture we paint of that problem must be as vivid andcomprehensive as we can make it, a picture that people across theorganization can validate, question, and challenge. As the leader, you are responsible for this. The artifact of this pro- cess (discussed a bit later in this chapter) involves creating a sum-mary document, which you’ll want to share with people as itmakes sense. In the fact gathering step, the leader plays the role of facilitator, and each participant is a discoverer. As a facilitator, your job is to makesure that every person involved leaves with the sense that they havereally been heard, and that their contributions will",

From the leader’s perspective, the important part of this step is going the extra mile to set appropriate context. Remind interviewees whyyou want to talk to them, let them know how it’s important, andshare with them who is involved and any key events that have hap-pened. The leader can do a lot to create a safe environment for thepeople being interviewed so they share as openly as possible. It can’tbe overstated how worthwhile it is to make the extra effort and fosterthe kind of environment where interview subjects don’t hold back.Unspoken concerns and silent objectives will only surface later. Responsibilities during the capture step for both the leader and the team are listed in Table 4-3. === Page 149 === Phase I: Question 129Step 3: Sharing the Findings Through interviewing and researching, you will discover a good col- lection of “facts,” hunches, insights, and perspectives. Some of thisinformation will be objectively true and validated in many ways.Some pieces of information may conflict with others. Some may notmake sense at all.TABLE 4-3. Step 2: Fact gathering roles and responsibilities LEADER’S ROLE •Do good discovery. —Select one or two people to do the fact gathering interviews and make sure they’re good at asking probing questions. Remember that the goal is to ask things devoid of judgment and full of curiosity. Choose interviewers who have personal credi-bility in the organization and are free of “political baggage” that might hinderpeople from talking openly. —Instruct the people doing interviews that not all facts are the same, so they need to listen for how confident the interviewee is about what they are saying (andhighlight those observations in their notes). —Make sure to choose a range of interviewees to generate a valuable diversity of opinion. —Consider calling interviewees ahead of time to let them know that this project is important and that your team truly wants to hear their opinions, hypotheses, feel-ings, data, and perspectives. That said, I’m reluctant to send people the questionsin advance, but I am happy to send them the topics. Sending questions locks youinto a survey-like fixed flow. Just the named topics without specific questionsallows greater flexibility to go where the conversation needs to go. •Foster open sharing. —Match the style of who is doing the interviewing with who is being interviewed, so the interviewee feels comfortable enough to give you good information. •Evaluate",

COLLABORATOR’S ROLE •Conduct interviews. —Seek out and organize relevant quantitative facts, with clear sourcing from docu- ments and databases. •Discuss/debate/synthesize findings. •Report findings to the organization. This is not an optional step. === Page 150 === Chapter 4 130The final step of the Question phase is to create a report back to the team or larger organization of stakeholders and players. I call this“sharing the findings.” The goal in this sharing phase is to create ashared understanding of the problem and the current situation. Before we can share findings, they need to be organized in a form that will make it straightforward to share with everybody, so they candevelop a shared understanding. Ultimately, this shared under-standing will become the information basis that in effect enables theorganization to think about the problem fully, and helps the teamdevelop a strategy that will solve the problem at hand. You’ll have to sort through the information and organize it into log- ical buckets to create more meaning. The way you organize thesefacts will change for every situation, but in general, the categoriestend to include what is known, what you believe, what you doubt,and what doesn’t fit, like this: What is known and can be confirmed This is information that is irrefutable, confirmed, and can be pre- sented as fact. This can include hard numbers from validatedsources, or it can be a series of facts gleaned from stories peoplehave told in the organization. Create two subcategories for thiskind of information: one bucket for information that has alreadybeen confirmed, and another bucket for information that needsto be confirmed. Note that if your data comes from a previousproject, make sure to put it in the “unconfirmed” bucket. Don’ttreat last year’s market share numbers or customer buying habits as automatically confirmed for this year! What you believe, but don’t have enough facts to confirm This is typically something you know or sense from your ownexperience or something many people believe, but that you lacksufficient data to support. It’s OK to have unconfirmed facts; justmake sure you tag them as such. Later, when you’re making deci-sions based on pivotal information, you’ll want to avoid the risk ofmaking a key decision on information that you never backed up. What you doubt This is information that somehow you don’t quite believe. It couldbe data from",

You can tag something as questionable, even if you don’t know exactly why you doubt it. Quite often, it is these points ofdoubt that show you where there are noticeable gaps betweenvarious people’s views of the situation. What doesn’t fit This section is for identifying any “red herrings” or stories thatpeople believe but that aren’t relevant to the task at hand. Forexample, perhaps there was some big sales deal that occurred inthe past and it’s used as an argument to take a particular courseof action. However, on closer inspection, the story is debunkedby some hidden assumptions or special circumstances. Anotherexample is when an issue that’s broadly recognized as a thorn inthe side of the business is inappropriately tied together with theproblem you’re trying to solve, because people think they can gettheir problem solved if they can associate it with somethingthat is going to get resolved and/or resourced. This is like anunrelated attachment to a piece of legislation that’s obviouslygoing to pass. When something is perpetually a problem in theorganization, people often find a way to drag that issue intoevery project or strategy because they hope it can be solved“alongside” the core mission youare carrying. However, this will dilute your efforts. So be clear about this type of issue so it canbe set aside and not revisited in every meeting. If it really is anissue, solve it discretely. At this point, you’ve filtered and categorized what you’ve learnedand put it into logical buckets so you can look at everything moreclearly. The next step is to create a document called a summary of key findings, which lets you share what you have learned, what youbelieve, and what you understand with the people throughout theorganization. The buckets we just talked about are a good exerciseand will help you develop your own deep understanding of what youhave discovered during the fact gathering step. However, they aren’tthe final output of your report. Your report back is a much morecomprehensive view and a story. When you’re confident that youhave a solid framework of key findings, you need to share it. Forrecommendations on doing this, see the “Building a FindingsFramework” exercise in Appendix A. === Page 152 === Chapter 4 132There are two compelling reasons for sharing the findings with",

First, you want to be certain that they have the opportu-nity to weigh in on what you’ve learned, and to shape and add to it.This ability to add perspectives is particularly valuable for multifacetedissues, so make sure the team knows that their feedback is welcome. As you share your findings, the team will have the opportunity to see the comprehensive range of things they need to address. They mayhave some new insight to share that will shape the view, or theymay simply see the situation in a whole new light. Be sure to captureany feedback or insights that come up during sharing. Second, the sharing provides an opportunity for many team mem- bers to learn things they didn’t know or weren’t comfortable admit- ting, which is essential to forming a common understanding. Part of the “team learning” aspect is coming to terms with the unvarnished truthof the situation. This can be an uncomfortable conversation, but it’sone you need to have in order to move forward. If it helps, consideryourself a reporter in this role, describing “what is” so that it can bedealt with. Figure 4-5 illustrates how the output of the Questionphase is all about shared understanding. Another way to look at the sharing activity is to think of it as publicly revealing the elephants that you discovered in the fact gathering step.Getting your team’s perspectives about the multifaceted topic givesshape to the different parts of the elephant that the blind mencouldn’t see. One thing that commonly happens during the sharingstep is the naming or spelling out of the elephant(s) in the room.

There are three high-level things tokeep in mind: •Present everything you say in terms of “early findings,” not astruth. Early findings suggest you are doing thorough fact gather-ing.Truth suggests you are making judgments (see Figure 4-6). •Don’t gloss over anything.

Don’t unnecessarily shelter them from the findings or appearto be confronting them in an aggressive way. The key part of this step is to ensure that team members call out all of the issues (and not try to duck, discount, or hide them) without neces- sarily trying to solve them. You may want to talk about company his-tory. You may want to list what hasn’t worked in the past so you can make sure to avoid those pitfalls. You may want to bring up anyFigure 4-6.

You may even want to draw out implications for what you think all the findings might mean. Again,good. Do all of that, but do so without making any recommendations. Sharing the findings: Roles and responsibilities Table 4-4 outlines the roles and responsibilities for leaders and col-laborators during this sharing step. Don’t run from any conflict, deal with it; it’s a necessary part of the process. One benefit of reporting the findings and getting resistanceis that it alerts you to areas and issues that might generate resistancelater in the process. Better to know now than later. Better to knowwhat you still need to ask/answer to address those issues. Face intothat tension to learn what you need to learn. Another thing that comes of this shared findings work is making sure those working on the problem don’t have confirmation bias—wherepeople more readily notice things that confirm what they believe andTABLE 4-4. Step 3: Sharing the findings roles and responsibilities LEADER’S ROLE •Manage the process of reporting findings back to the organization, so that later recommendations are based on a fuller understanding of the problem: —Invite people to this reporting process who are key to solving the problem or who need to have the full picture in order to support the effort. —Let collaborators know that this is an early check-in process.

You can say things like, “I want to let you know that this next information may be asurprise to some of you. We heard XYZ, and we found that about half the groupsees this as a problem we need to address.” —Call out issues, but make it clear that the point of the session is not to solve them, only to surface them.

Confirmation bias skews the facts when data that supports a belief is included preferentiallyand data that is contradictory gets filtered out. When the report backis public, people are less likely to become victims of confirmationbias, because at some level they think that any distortion of the factswill be exposed. There is a natural self-correction built into thesystem when findings are shared publicly.

You, as the leader, will oversee the interviews, create the sum-mary findings, and organize how facts get reported back. Take care inchoosing the people who are doing the interviewing, that a representa-tive variety of people are being interviewed, and that the informationyou gather is fully validated and understood by your organizationbefore you move forward. Although you might wish to delegate thetask of reporting back what the fact gathering step uncovered, ulti-mately it’s still the leader’s responsibility to manage the discussionthat surrounds the event. The Goal: Getting Shared Understanding The Question phase creates buy-in among the organization because ifyou have the courage to call out the issues and publicly report backwhat you think needs to be solved and why, the broader population generally comes around and starts to naturally support the effort. That doesn’t mean this part is easy. It just means this part is necessary. Recall that we talked about how when we know the problem, we can solve the problem. That naturally happens in the Question phase. Evenif you didn’t get the right problem statement at the start of it, you willhave a chance to test it and change it if necessary. We’ve described the process as talking to key people and engaging them in conversation without trying to solve anything. There’s anopenness to doing the questioning so you can keep learning. It’s thislearning during Question that lets you understand the situation fullyand with a broader view than if you jumped straight into problemsolving. You also will see the individual problems that often are partof a single big problem. Until you unravel the issues with a degree ofclarity, you cannot address all the holistic or core issues. === Page 157 === Phase I: Question 137Of course, we complete the Question phase by naming the problem in public. This may seem unnecessary, but it is a key output of thisphase. By naming all of the issues, the people involved won’t beducking, discounting, or hiding them. At this point, you’ve alreadyachieved some success. But there’s still something else that needs tohappen. The purpose of sharing the findings is to build a full, 360-degree view of the problem in people’s minds with minimal bias, so that teammembers have a larger understanding of the problem itself.

If you blur the lines between thiseffort and the next phase, you’re less likely to have clarity amongstthe people involved. This means you’ll have accomplished part of thegoal of Question, but will miss an opportunity for people to click ontheir brains to get it, challenge it, and make it their own. After sharing the findings, you and your team have a clear and shared picture of the problem. You now enter the second phase of theQuEST process framework, Envision. Envision is where people get towork on the creation and development of your strategy options. This isoften the most enjoyable part of a project, because you get to startworking on the solutions to all these problems. So, let’s have some fun. === Page 159 === Chapter 5CHAPTER 5 Phase II: Envision Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world. —Arthur Schopenhauer Create Options That Matter and Know Why They Matter Knowing that insights reside everywhere and new solutions can come from anywhere, we need a systematic way to gather, analyze, anddevelop new, creative options to solve the problem—without beingbogged down. That’s what the second phase of the QuEST processframework, Envision, is all about. It’s where we generate a widerange of options for solving the problem, and begin to track the cri-teria that will ultimately let us choose the best options based on ourshared vision of success. If you are like most people, you start this chapter with some context for how to approach problem solving through idea generation andbrainstorming techniques. 1The weakness with these tools and tech- niques is that people use them assuming that the best idea willbecome apparent. However, people often generate a range of ideaswithout a clear idea of whether those choices will actually work,given the organization’s internal capabilities and market situation. TheEnvision phase lets you use whatever approach you want for idea === Page 160 === Chapter 5 140generation, but adds a nuance to the process by recognizing that not all solutions are right for a particular company. Envision aims to answer the question, “What is the right set of options for you, given your problem and particular set of circum- stances?” It’s not about blue-sky thinking and generating the broadestset of options. It’s about focusing and generating options that are mostlikely to work, knowing that best theoretically and best practically are two",

The Envision phase (Figure 5-1) is important because, until we’ve had a chance to gather all the viable options, we won’t be able toselect among the best of them. Envision lets an organization use col-laboration to generate solutions. Because you have named theproblem already in the Question phase, you can now open up thefloor to the best ideas from unexpected sources. This is done in a flatstructure that allows for open input. Because so much is knownabout idea generation, this chapter is going to focus on how best todo options development, and then how these options and the selec-tion criteria feed into the next phase (Select). Let’s look at how the Envision phase will help you come up with viable options to solve your strategy problem and generate the neces-sary outcomes for your business. Figure 5-1. Envision is the second phase of QuEST === Page 161 === Phase II: Envision 141How to Do It There are two short-and-sweet steps to the Envision phase: •Developing a rich set of options •Tracking criteria that will be used to shape decisions in the Select phase (Phase III) As you leave the last step in the Question phase, you have a group ofpeople with a shared understanding of the real problem. At thispoint, they are champing at the bit to actually solve the problem, andthis is the time to let those people loose to identify viable solutions. In the Envision phase, the goal is to tap into the latent power in your organization by asking people to contribute toward fixing theproblem. In this phase, we include people at all levels in the organiza-tion so we can generate a diversity of ideas on the table. Ideally, thisensures that the aperture for potential solutions is as wide as pos-sible. This is a good place to use those collaborative tools (listed inAppendix A) that let you do mass idea generation and brainstormingso that gathering options goes quickly. Some of these tools also letyou camouflage the source of input so you can protect people fromthe risk of looking stupid or naming a political issue that stands inthe way of the organization’s success. There is no such thing as “the right answer.” There is something that is best for you, given yourproblem and particular set of circumstances. Envision that. The other part of this phase is to keep the focus on “why” something matters. In order",

This is the reason that we call out criteria tracking in the Envision phase. It lets you gather many, manyideas, while starting to draw distinctions as to why one option mightbe better than another. So let’s talk about both of these pieces—option development and criteria tracking—in this chapter. === Page 162 === Chapter 5 142Step 1: Option Development In option development, you slow down enough to involve many people in thinking things through and understanding all of your pos-sible choices, so that when you’re ready to make a choice, you have arich pool of options to evaluate. Be sure to involve the people who do the hands-on work in the busi- ness; they’re better able to see the day-to-day challenges and act as asource of new options and key insights. Include people outside thebusiness (partners, suppliers, channels, etc.) if you want to be openabout solving the problem and could use their outside-in perspec-tive. You’ll have many good options, and later we can understand thedistinct impact each would have on the business. Face-to-face meetings traditionally have been the source of brain- storming work, but there are several compelling ways to do this kindof problem solving with collaborative tools. Whether you hold sev-eral brainstorming and discussion meetings in person or host a brain-storming session online, the focus of each session will be driven bythe dynamics of your specific situation. For example, you may wantto have an entire meeting devoted to developing a particular idea,looking at product options, exploring regional alternatives, or what-ever type of results you are considering. In option development meetings, the focus is on exploring possibili- ties: “What if we…?”, “Is there a reason why…?”, and “What wouldhappen if we tried…?” You may need to integrate different tech-niques for different aspects of the project. In addition to includingvarious domain experts, you may want to bring in people withinquisitive, provocative, or energetic styles, though be sure to bal-ance that energy with the sense of safety that the team needs to feel inmaking contributions. 2 It’s important to explore many different angles on the options youcould pursue, and to make sure that you engage everyone on thoseoptions that are relevant to them. This doesn’t have to mean bringingeveryone together at the same time (although that",

If so, how can it be handled? How do proposals from otherfunctional groups influence them? How does our competition do it?How will our competition respond? What if energy prices rise? Whatif? What if? However you approach this, make sure you probe for abroad set of perspectives. Often we are limited by our specific near-term experience. To ensure a holistic viewpoint, task a knowledge-able and open-minded person with representing each aspect of yourproject during ideation. 3 As you begin to produce some ideas and options, you or someoneelse on the team may realize that there are embedded criteria beingused to either create or filter the options list. That is fine, and indeedis part of the reason these two steps are part of the same phase. Butyou must ensure that you make criteria explicit and keep them in dif-ferent buckets while developing options. Some of the more creative ideas may require some investigating before you can answer questions such as: “Can we actually do that?”,“What would it take?”, “How does this currently work today?”,“What are the current barriers?” In this case, you may need to revisitthe Question phase to dig up more information. Don’t let this deteryou. If the idea is compelling, further digging may take you to anexciting and powerful new solution—or not. You won’t know inadvance. What’s important is to be sure that you keep the teamaligned around what you are doing, and how that affects the even-tual picture of what success could look like. Leading the option development step Option development generates a full range of ideas that offer poten-tial ways to solve the problem, as well as a solid understanding ofhow these ideas compare to each other in terms of their impact onthe organization. Option development is directed creative problem solving. There are myriad ways to structure and manage such processes. Again, checkout the resources section in Appendix B. Choose whatever methodworks for you and your team. === Page 164 === Chapter 5 144For the option development step to be effective, you need to foster an environment in which people feel safe enough to rigorouslydebate ideas, share their wide-ranging opinions, and keep theirdefense shields down long enough to build on one another’s ideas.Safety is an",

As the leader, your key role is to make surethere’s a safe environment. If you are interested in passionately advo-cating and building your set of proposed solutions, make suresomeone else is facilitating and driving the process for everyone. Leaders as facilitators serve more like the host of the party than the guest of honor. You are hosting a party where people are expected tocome ready to play and to have a good, productive time. In your roleas facilitator, you will oversee the details of the event, as a skilledparty planner would. As your guests arrive and while the party is infull swing, you’ll manage their interactions, keeping things runningsmoothly so people want to come again.Managing Temptation: Saving the Ideas You Personally Like The value of facilitation is often overlooked. You will be tempted to lead the meeting and not acknowledge that your own passionate point ofview can limit discussion. But here is the truth: you cannot be both thecontent player and the group owner without sacrificing the quality ofone or the other. I know most leaders think they can do both at the sametime, but when they’ve been freed to focus just on content, they see howthey were straddling too many things to do content andlead the process well. If something is incredibly important to the business (like a strat-egy), you need to make sure all points of view are heard. For optiondevelopment to succeed, the process must be led without a bias towardchoosing one option or one leader’s voice having too much dominance.When the leader is opinionated (and what leader isn’t?), someone elsehas to manage the flow of conversation to make sure all points of vieware raised/heard/managed. Therefore, the process must be managed bya specific someone with that distinct responsibility. Don’t let that getsacrificed, or you will have done the business a disservice. === Page 165 === Phase II: Envision 145Leaders who are not strong in the role of “host” or “facilitator” may choose to delegate or outsource this role. For more information on therole of host, refer to “Facilitation” on page 254 in Appendix B.

As the facilitator or as the content leader, you should get the ball rolling by proposing some semi-outrageous notions, such as, “Should it be solar powered?”, “Should it have speech recognition?”, or whatever outside-the-box suggestion you might have. As the leader, you willhave a certain amount of permission to take such an approach. Table 5-1 lists the responsibilities that leaders, facilitators, and col- laborators have during option development. Managing Temptation: Wanting Harmony Instead of Productive Conflict In the option development step, you may be tempted to promote group harmony instead of facilitating productive disagreement. This is totallynatural. People on the team will say or imply that harmony is what theywant. This is because they value keeping their working relationships assmooth as possible, and they may not look forward to disagreeing witheach other, especially in a public or semi-public forum. Your job, then,will be to lead option development so that opinions and disagreementare welcomed, invited, and expected, and even investigated as potentialsources of creative energy. Here’s the thing: our business challengescome with inherent tensions. By acknowledging and addressing thosetensions as we develop ideas rather than smoothing things over, we’llend up with an even stronger, more viable set of options. It’s one ofthose pay-me-now or pay-me-later choices. The tension is going to bethere. The question is whether you harness it during options and solu-tions creation or wait until a strategy failure occurs, like the one Idescribed in Chapter 1. === Page 166 === Chapter 5 146TABLE 5-1. Step 1: Option development roles and responsibilities LEADER’S ROLE •Pay attention to who you invite to the meetings, and be sure you aren’t inviting the same set of people repeatedly. The purpose of these sessions is to generate freshperspectives. •Invite those with on-the-ground experience about what is going on, what works, andwhat needs fixing. •Invite people who can give you a lateral perspective on how other departments ordivisions will be affected. •Invite constructive critics who almost always start their sentences with “But youhaven’t thought about….” These critics can remind you of what you need to consider. •Set context. Let people know at the outset that you’re looking for fresh perspectives.Tell them you expect them to step outside their domain areas and create new solu-tions.

FACILITATOR’S ROLE •Establish the norms of the group at the outset of the meeting. For example: “If you’rehere, you need to be here .” (In other words, no email, no phone calls, no text messages.) Reinforce these norms as needed. •Manage the flow of the conversation and the tensions inherent in decision making. •Seek a balance between support and confrontation, and a fair balance betweenwhom you support and confront. •Ensure that people are able to express a diversity of opinions. The session should notbe treated as “open mic night,” but rather as a guided experience of creativity whereeveryone gets to weigh in and contribute. •Monitor the quality of conversations so that they are as productive as possible. Thismay mean switching from a structured format to a more improvisational one(drawing versus talking, small groups versus large groups, creating Post-its as indi-viduals). You make the call as to what is needed. •Be alert to the environment in terms of physical comfort. Does the room have enoughnatural light? Is the room warm enough? Cold enough? Do you need cookies in theafternoon? (I have found the lack of cookies to be one of the biggest impediments toquality idea generation.) •Manage the environment in terms of people’s emotional comfort. People generategood ideas when they feel free and safe to do so. If your team is facing heavy layoffsor is preoccupied with some other serious concern, you may want to consider post-poning the session. === Page 167 === Phase II: Envision 147In the option development step, everyone is undertaking a deeper creative act than any one person could do alone. You get to bringtogether experts in different domains—engineers, marketing, andsales channel specialists. Inspire them to work together to generateideas outside their individual expertise. Co-creating like this simply doesn’t happen when people are hesitant to speak their minds for fear of stepping on toes, damaging new working relationships, or drivinginto a “career cul-de-sac.” As described in Chapters 2 and 3, the tonefor this dialogue is set by everyone.

Capture those ideas while theyare fresh. This is called criteria tracking because you are identifyingthe footprints and patterns that seem to dictate whether one option isbetter than another. Criteria tracking does not need to be treated ascompletely distinct from option development. That is, the two stepscan overlap somewhat. In practice, this means you’ll initially focuson option development with occasional moments of criteria tracking.Later, in the Envision phase, you’ll be doing some criteria trackingthat will spark more option development. Criteria tracking is parallel to option development in another way: it is about creating a rich set of potential criteria for evaluating visionsof success. This criteria list will be sorted and prioritized during theCO-CREATOR’S ROLE •Bring your ideas and creativity to bear on the problem. •Advocate/champion/lobby for ideas you believe need to be fully heard. •“Sit forward” into the process.

Criteria tracking also serves another useful function: it provides some effective separation between the idea gen-eration space of the Envision phase and the idea rejection space ofthe Select phase. As you build your list, include criteria from each area: product devel- opment, sales, operations, and so on. The intent behind criteria tracking is to gather what matters to the team and your organization so thatduring the next phase, Select, you can make the most well-informedchoice among all your strategy ideas. You are seeking to answer sev-eral questions: How will we know when we’re winning? What doessuccess look like? Where do we want to be? How does this influencewhat other moves our company can make? Some people havedescribed this as tightly linked to a corporate mission. Often that will be true. But sometimes the criteria for a particular strategy will be unique for its own reasons. The point to remember is that the criteria you develop now will determine how you choose amongst all these options. It’s important thatthese criteria align with the larger mission of the organization, to make sure that you’re not abandoning",

Doing things in alignment with the core mission and vision ofa firm can accelerate success (Figure 5-2). Figure 5-2. Knowing what matters to us === Page 169 === Phase II: Envision 149There are two key points to remember about criteria tracking. First, you want to expose tacit assumptions about the project goal and helpyour team come to a shared and explicit understanding about whatmatters. People in different roles often disagree about what successwill look like. Finance may want the new project to address ananticipated revenue shortfall. Business development may want thenew project to win a potential new partner. Engineering may see theproject as a chance to learn a new technology. Resolving these ten-sions in an agreed-upon way is vital to the project. This can make abig difference in the ultimate success of the business solution. Forexample, the product development team might be motivated andeven incentivized to keep capital equipment costs down, but whenthey understand that doing so is less important than schedule orquality (or whatever), they can take this to finance and explain whythey need more in their budget. That’s an example of a decision thatteams make after selecting criteria because they understand theinherent criteria and trade-offs. The full debate on criteria can waituntil the Select phase, because at this point you want to focus onbringing things to the surface. Debating why something matters instead of which idea is best lets people think collaboratively. Second, explicit shared criteria give the entire team a shared vocabu-lary for “where we want to be” and will help each team memberknow how to make decisions at any point in the process where theyneed to make a trade-off. They will be aware of the underlying logicof the strategy and be able to articulate it. This is a benefit of collabo- rative strategy. The leader won’t hold the criteria alone; everyone will get it. People sometimes don’t understand what forms criteria, so Table 5-2 lists some examples that can be useful for spurring the creation of arich list of potential criteria. === Page 170 === Chapter 5 150Criteria are ultimately another way to foster the culture of thinkers and strategists who can arrive at their own answers and drive for-ward the business without needing explicit direction.

When we have shared criteria, we enable a healthy and thriving culture of problem solvers ratherthan simply doers. This is a key notion of the New How. Start with an open question One simple question to start the criteria tracking step is: “How willwe know when we are done?” This question gets people thinkingabout what the solution should look like, without specifically consid-ering any options. Another question is: “Imagine you are looking at aseries of options of what we could do and pointing and saying,‘That’s the ONE!’ What about that solution makes you sure?” Thisquestion helps people start to consciously identify their decision-making criteria and helps them communicate explicitly what willdrive the decision for them.TABLE 5-2.

The understanding must be shared so each person on the team has a chance to talk about, internalize, andagree on the criteria or evidence of success. Consensus is important, but so is progress. If one or a few people do not agree, allow a littleextra time to resolve the differences. If it still does not resolve, theleader or leaders will need to make a call. It may be appropriate toremind the team that once the options have been aired and dis-cussed, the co-creators have a duty to support judgment calls. InChapter 2,",

Discussing the criteria in detail gives team members an opportunity to clarify what’s most important by adding essential details or identi-fying and removing extraneous elements that might contribute toconfusion. Agreeing on and internalizing the criteria are essential pieces of the overall process. Individual team members will draw on their internal-ized criteria to inform and guide the selection of the one beststrategy from the final strategy options. They’ll also use the criteriaas a decision-making guide downstream during the execution of theproject. Your team’s ability to select the right strategy is the logicalbyproduct of each team member having internalized the indicators oraspects of success. Their shared agreement is also valuable because itencourages individuals to support others through the project. With this in mind, your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to lead your team through the thinking process to develop quality cri- teria. This involves helping each member of your team reach a uni-fied sense of what is most important and why. Although the debatemust result in a set of criteria that you as a leader can live with, it’salso important that you give the team permission to add to the con-clusions.

Identifying the criteria openly is also important because it allows people to state what is important to them as a team, as a division,and as an organization, and it helps them internalize why thestrategy is important (that is, not just because “Bob said so”).When everyone is able to express their ideas for success, you win intwo ways. You gain the advantage of potential upsides: some of theideas will be very good. And you eliminate some downsides: later on,people won’t spend a lot of time fretting over whether their ideamight have made things better, because they will know.

COLLABORATOR’S ROLE •Think about and surface criteria suggestions. •Make tacit assumptions explicit. •Question or challenge any criteria that do not seem legitimate. •Understand and agree on the final criteria. Ultimately support the selected criteria. === Page 173 === Phase II: Envision 153quantifiable the various dimensions of this project are in people’s hearts and minds, the better they can make decisions that supportsuccess. When you are capturing criteria, the debate is often as valuable as the actual result. The outcome itself may not come as much of a surpriseto you, but your team’s discussion as you’re developing criteria willgive each individual on the team time to internalize what is impor-tant and why. What’s most important about criteria tracking is that you turn unspoken assumptions into explicit and shared insights. The Goal: Achieving Viable Options That People Believe In During the Envision phase, you’ll generate, capture, and articulate a full range of options that create potential strategic solutions. Because of theway people have been asked to participate in creating this option, you’llhave some buy-in within the organization.

So you will be tempted to make your views known and thenmove directly on to what you might mistakenly believe is the actualwork. Don’t leave your team out of the criteria tracking process.

Wright Mills Killing Off Bad Ideas So Good Ideas Can Thrive At a three-year product strategy meeting at Apple during the early 1990s, the McKinsey hired guns presented something I now refer toas the “99-idea slide” as the final summary of a strategy presentation.It was chock-full of information, presented in a visually compellingway. It showed all the viable product strategies we could pursue. With its combined richness and graphical simplicity, the 99-idea slide wowed all of us. Shortly after the presentation, the meeting broke up. Apparently, we were “done” with our strategy process, and we had an impressivePowerPoint deck to show for it. I was befuddled. I wondered what Iwas missing. Maybe other people had a larger view or perspective—some special awareness—that helped everything make sense. Itdidn’t seem like we’d actually made any decisions, but perhaps wehad and I had missed it. The 99-idea slide was impressive, but Iwasn’t sure what it meant for the work I was leading. Was someone === Page 176 === Chapter 6 156going to tell me what the implications were? Or was it assumed that I already knew? As it turned out, it wasn’t just me; we were all unclear. Not one of the participants knew how to put the strategy into practice. So, likemany consulting reports before them, the binders moved from thedesk to the bookshelf and, finally, out of view.

In this instance, the strategy was considered crucial, so we had taken a very different tack than we had with prior product strategies. In thepast, a few execs had gotten together and quickly come up with someoptions, and the rest of us were told what to do. With help from theconsultants, we had done a great job of whiteboarding and researchto generate a vetted list of many viable options. These myriad optionshad opened up a Pandora’s box, however. Having such a huge list tochoose from was, in some ways, worse than having a shorter, less-considered list of options. 1 So what was missing from our strategy? Perhaps it is obvious, but ittook me some time to figure out that we lacked an underlying pro-cess that would have allowed us to winnow the many options downto the right option (Figure 6-1). Figure 6-1. The search for strategy === Page 177 === Phase III: Select 157What was missing was a way to decide which of the available stra- tegic options made the most sense for usto do. We had no organized way to select a strategy from the list. And, at least as important, weneeded a way to determine which of the available options we shouldnotpursue. In other words, we needed a way to kill off options so we could focus on moving forward. Selecting “The One” Perhaps you are thinking that any one of the options on the table in agiven situation would have been good enough, and in fact that mightbe true. Sometimes good enough is indeed enough. But more often,choosing the best option matters. In this case, the “best” option iswhatever makes the most sense for this organization, at this partic-ular time, given the market conditions, matched to internal capabili-ties, considering allocated resources, and so on. By selecting the bestoption, you have a higher likelihood of achieving the vision behindthe strategy. Imagine your goal is to cross a vast expanse of territory to acquire something of value and return safely. The kind of vehicle you selectto achieve this goal will depend on what particular territory you’recrossing—its topography, climate, and obstacles—as well as thecargo you need to transport, the amount of risk that’s acceptable,and the resources you have available. If you have mountains to traverse, for example, you might choose a helicopter.",

Each vehicle has particular characteristics and strengths thatmake it the right vehicle for a particular terrain: its rate of speed, itsability to move past obstacles, the number of people it can carry fromhere to there. Strategy development works in much the same way. By the time you arrive at the 99-point slide, what you find in front of you is the equiv- alent to a fine array of nice-looking transportation vehicles that you’ve worked very hard to assemble. Each of them will appear to get youfrom here to there. But which do you choose? Helicopter? Biplane?Humvee? Hovercraft? How will you decide? Might you need toinvolve a person who knows the details about the terrain, the cargo,and your resources? In practical terms, obviously, it’s essential to === Page 178 === Chapter 6 158make a decision. It wouldn’t work to have half the team prepare the hovercraft and the other half jump in the helicopter. Unintentionallypursuing multiple options in parallel will waste resources and putyour best people in competition for no good reason. Failing tochoose means failing to achieve the goal. With respect to strategy selection, deciding on one strategy option will dramatically improve your chances of getting where you want to go. For any given situation, one option is superior to all others. The question is, which one? And is there really just one answer? I think there is. But let me beclear that by onestrategy I mean an inclusive and complete strategy. So “one” is not about a singular idea. One strategy can contain manydifferent ideas, but they must come together in a unified way. At anoperating level, this might look like one channel strategy, or oneretail strategy, or one enterprise strategy, or a combination of ideas,as long as they work as a unified whole. Using our prior example oftransportation vehicles, we would use the word “helicopter” todescribe the capabilities and discrete items that come together toform an entire strategy. The word itself is simply a container thatcombines many things within it. It’s the kind of “one” that poet WaltWhitman evokes in “I contain multitudes.” And when I use “one,” I am using the word as a kind of logical handle that lets us simplify theway we talk about the array of complex options we ultimately need toprioritize.

When the issue of “what not to do” is left unanswered, strategies get interpreted many different ways andcan fail as a result. Under the time pressure of everyday business and in the absence of a good selection process, teams tend not to build a rich list of options,since doing so often seems to make the decision process harder. Thatis, organizations and teams that have a selection process actually do abetter job of generating options to win. === Page 179 === Phase III: Select 159So what you need is a process framework that allows your group to kill off ideas and get to the right strategy for that time and that situa-tion. You need an agreed-upon way to work with the necessary mixof people to align with what’s important so you can shorten the list,dig into the details of the remaining options to figure out what’sdoable, and finally, fix what’s not quite right to get to a limited set oftruly interesting options. If the limited set has only one option,you’re done. Otherwise, you and your team need to weigh the itemsagainst each other and make a decision so that you have a single agreed-upon strategy. Not only that, but you have to do it fast, or thenext time people will revert to the command-and-control option ofdeciding and telling others. The framework that can help organizations make complex yet sub- jective strategic decisions is one I affectionately call Murder-Boarding. You might think it sounds a bit sinister, but successfulbusinesses use this framework strategy for good purposes. MurderBoarding: What Is It? MurderBoarding is a kind of counterweight to whiteboarding as abrainstorming tool. Instead of creating an unbounded set of newideas, its purpose is to enable teams to evaluate many options effec-tively, yet still converge on the winning choice in a bounded time-frame. It’s a framework to help you make the best decisions thataffect large groups or social systems, for the good of an organization.It’s also a crucial step in the collaborative strategy process, because itallows a decision to be made around qualitative messy choices. Thus it overcomes some key obstacles to effective team collaboration,namely the “Kumbaya” consensus orientation that often besetsteams. MurderBoarding highlights the focused, methodical, and premeditated mindset required for killing off even worthy ideas. It’s not just theweak ideas that get killed; good options or",

MurderBoarding is not about team spirit inany way. It is about a selection and decision framework that lets youand your organization make tough choices amongst good options. === Page 180 === Chapter 6 160As a reminder, all of this fits into the QuEST process as the third phase, Select (Figure 6-2). We need a framework to allow organizations to move past the fact gathering and options development steps (embodied by either the 99-point slide or the criteria tracking step of the Envision phase) toachieve convergence. The framework must take into account themany reasons why people have a tough time making choices. Weneed to work fast, navigate the complexities of an organization, andideally enable the organization to make interdependent downstreamdecisions in alignment with the core strategy. The MurderBoardingframework addresses these needs by: •Doing adequate discovery of what makes sense •Transforming often-tacit beliefs into explicit decision criteria •Debating and understanding what matters and why Sometimes it helps to know how this fits into other managementtools. MurderBoarding is not like scenario planning or decision-treeanalysis; it’s not meticulous quantitative analysis or a predictivemodeling tool. Instead, the goal of MurderBoarding is to enable crit-ical conversations between people so that they can explore essentialsuccess criteria, evaluate trade-offs, test ideas, understand oneanother, and work together to pick the best strategy. MurderBoarding is about optimizing your selection, not“maximizing” or “satisficing,” which only aims to meet a minimum set of require- ments. Using our example of transportation options, satisficing wouldFigure 6-2. Select (via MurderBoarding) is the third phase of QuEST === Page 181 === Phase III: Select 161be the equivalent of choosing the first or easiest option that seemed to work (biplane?), and being done with it. By contrast, with maxi-mizing, a person wants to make the absolute ideal decision. Even if they review several choices and find a great option that seems to meettheir requirements, they can’t make a decision until after they’ve fully examined every option. This sometimes means never making a deci- sion, and always means driving the average forward-thinking businessexecutive crazy. Optimizing a decision is about making the decision based on a preselected set of criteria (including schedule) that youand your team can debate.

This lets every- one be thinking partners, rather than having one (executive) group that “thinks” and another (lower-level management) that “does.” This, of course, lets organizations close the systemic Air Sandwich mentioned earlier. •People and teams have confidence that they will be able to movequickly from a rich list of viable options to a single strategy, sothey are willing to build this list rather than go on gut instinct. •Strategies are chosen based on their merits, risks, and feasibility. •Strategies have more legitimacy because teams can see andunderstand the robust, transparent process. Substrategies canthen be created in support of the core strategy. •Resources are not squandered, since teams understand the activi-ties they shouldn’t do. The last point about resources is worthy of elaboration, especiallyconsidering our current economic climate. Many companies havebeen forced to cut costs, but they have often lacked a way to intelli-gently discern what should be cut. MurderBoarding provides a wayto do resource alignment intelligently rather than randomly.

You know you’re at this point when you find yourself asking, “Which one makes sense?” • A situation that has changed in a variety of ways since the lastbusiness review. • The organization seems to have lost its focus. • A high-stakes opportunity (millions of dollars) that justifies theinvestment of a thorough review. • A new vision that requires people to stop doing what they’ve beendoing and shift to something new. Here are some sample questions that may signal a need for Murder- Boarding. If your division could focus on only one thing in the coming year, what would it be? Should you take your product to another country tofurther develop and invest in it? Do you want to focus on your existing franchise and expand the customer base to mid-markets? Should you make more product improvements to keep up with the low-end com-petitors entering the space? Which idea makes sense? Has the organiza-tion lost its focus? MurderBoarding will help you understand how each option serves the larger goals of the organization and decide the course of action that willserve your situation best. Being clear about a course",

People tend to resist change fiercely when they don’t see what’s in it for them, and MurderBoarding provides a structured way to align people toa new strategy. The sidebar “Turning Around a Big Ship” on page 165illustrates a situation in which a new leader used a framework to reacha common understanding of what success looks like. This situation hada key element that signaled a need to do MurderBoarding. === Page 183 === Phase III: Select 163Steps to MurderBoarding There are four basic steps in the MurderBoarding framework (Figure 6-3): Decide what matters This step is about gaining agreement and making explicit the things that all your stakeholders care about. It is figuring out, asa team, what is important to the business and determining themust-have criteria that should shape the strategy selection deci-sion. Deciding what matters means explicitly setting aside thenice-to-have items. Once an organization is aligned on what itwants to do (or be), it can make the tough choices. Sort This step is about organizing ideas. It involves making a first-passcomparison of options against the criteria of what matters. Sortinghelps to triage possible solutions, and to find out whether addi-tional criteria will be needed to further evaluate the options.When you have too many ideas to act on and you need to focus, MurderBoarding is a razor-sharp tool to help you slice away at fuzzy thinking. When gut feelings no longer provide enough clarity about which direction to take, MurderBoarding helps you make toughchoices and can give you the confidence to move forward in a definitiveway. When people see things differently and can’t agree, Murder-Boarding provides a mental elevator that your team can board togetherto rise above the individual perspectives, so that everyone can align to acommon, higher-order vision of success. There are many situations where teams should engage in the Murder- Boarding process framework. But some situations do not call for MurderBoarding: • When a straightforward change is being considered that clearly has no cross-functional impact. • When the criteria for success are known, shared, and have notchanged. • When the stakes are low and consequences are minor.

It is about going out in the organizationto learn more, gather additional facts, and refine criteria further.Within the testing process, you fix, toss, tune, and merge ideas,molding them into fully vetted, executable strategy options. Choose The last step is about making the decision—sometimes easy,often messy—together. It is about selecting the most appropri-ate idea given the situation you face today. Choosing is the lastand most vital phase of MurderBoarding because the resultdefines your strategy. If you don’t choose and you don’t con-verge, then you don’t have a strategy. And you can’t win. If you don’t choose, you don’t have a strategy; you just have a set of options. Step 1: Decide What Matters When a team can say clearly what matters in the decision, they willbe able to see their strategy options with sharper focus and makeimportant distinctions between the options. Deciding what matters isabout getting to the heart and soul of an issue, enabling you to seethe difference between an adequate strategy idea and an extraordi-nary one for a specific situation.Figure 6-3.

The C-Suite brought her in as a “change agent” tolead an existing 700-person team with a new charter to establish thecompany’s platform in the face of such titans as Adobe, Google, andMicrosoft. Her mission was to retake command of a market that thecompany had actually initiated, but long ago lost. The good news was that the company’s competitors were all building their platforms from scratch, and Rita’s company already had a plat-form in place. The bad news was that the company had a legacy plat-form, and people would need to change what they were working on.Rita was having a hard time implementing this shift, with her peoplesaying they were too overwhelmed with their current work to even havea meeting to explain all the things that were on their plates.

But the team thought they were doing what mattered. They couldn’t imagine stopping “just because.” That would mean deciding to do noth-ing instead of something important. Before she could get the team tomake a decision to stop something, she needed to get them to revisit andagree upon what really mattered to them. I counseled Rita that this was in fact her next move. And she was able to use the MurderBoarding framework to get her team clear on theimperative to change, to agree upon what success actually looked like(beating those titans and reinventing their platform!), and then tochoose what they would start and stop doing to refocus. Because theMurderBoarding framework engages the team in identifying what’simportant, they were able to get aligned without the normal politicalinfighting. Without that alignment around the imperative, theycouldn’t imagine that there might have been something better to dothan what they were already doing. —continued— === Page 186 === Chapter 6 166Your own experience may have already taught you that successful strategies are those where the whole organization knows the answersto questions such as: Where do we want to be? How will we knowwhen we’re winning? What does success look like? The answers tothese questions become a cohesive understanding that drives theteam’s choices. The previous chapter already covered the need totrack what matters in the context of developing strategy ideas, butdeciding what matters (and criteria tracking) is actually applied hereas part of the MurderBoarding framework (Figure 6-4). Typically, there are only two or three things that really matter when distinguishing between strategy options. Getting to “what really mat-ters” requires some detective work to determine what is important inyour specific circumstance, with your team, and in your market orcompany at this particular moment. Before considering the options, start by figuring out what should shape the decision. Ultimately, this increases the relevance of thefinal idea or choice. These criteria remind you, as the leader, thatRita needed to ask questions about the new strategy and what the team felt mattered: • Why are we doing what we’re doing now? • How is this serving us? • How well do we understand the new objective? • Do we agree the new objective",

It isn’t aboutgood or bad, right or wrong—it’s about which one fits your goalsmost closely. Every organization has a number of belief systems that influence which criteria will be chosen. Some beliefs are explicit and thereforelargely shared, but many are unspoken (tacit) and are typically held inconsistently throughout the organization. The tacit beliefs usuallytie in to people’s underlying sense of identity and of what the firm/product/business “is.” Tacit beliefs can be problematic when theyanchor people—and therefore the organization—to the past,thinking about what they’ve done or have been rather than what they could do or be. The analogy of an anchor is appropriate because it’s theanchor that keeps a ship stuck, unable to maneuver away from an oncoming storm or seek out new harbors. Some organizations are soanchored that new strategies are hard to find. Beliefs profoundly influence the organization’s vision of what suc- cess looks like. Whereas explicit beliefs are often fairly consistentacross the team, tacit beliefs differ across the organization and canlead to “hidden agendas,” which are, effectively, different tacitcriteria. You’ll often see tacit beliefs in teams that have been siloedand stable for a long time. The team’s criteria for success will beFigure 6-4. Step 1 of the MurderBoarding framework: Decide what matters === Page 188 === Chapter 6 168driven by belief systems both tacit and explicit. A common agenda is essential to implementing a successful strategy, so it is important toensure that you surface all the tacit beliefs and the resulting hiddenagendas so that the teams can align. When beliefs are tacit, they can influence a group’s unconscious",

Tacit beliefs left unidentified can subtly lead the group to choose astrategy that is aligned with the unspoken beliefs but is less optimalfor the situation at hand. It is critical, then, to identify existingbeliefs, and to surface tacit beliefs and make them explicit. Surfacingtacit beliefs allows them to be reconsidered, checked to see whetherthey are commonly shared, and evaluated to determine whether theyare still applicable or need to be changed. Writing beliefs down andspeaking them out loud allows a group to understand the intentbehind historical decisions and to evaluate whether those beliefs stillhold true or need to be adapted to move forward. Of course, thisrequires a discussion to take place with the involved parties.Exploring these beliefs will lead to an understanding of what mattersto this organization, and why. Saying things out loud allows you to bring clarity of thought to what you are saying, and gives others the opportunity to challenge theideas. This explicit dialogue can prevent a whole team from makingdecisions based on false assumptions, or coming to the mistaken con-clusion that people are aligned in purpose when they are not. So how can you find those tacit beliefs? What telltale signs give hints about those submerged ideas? And how do you identify the explicitbeliefs so that you can make a thorough inventory of them, to helpdistinguish them from the hidden ones? It turns out that many cluesare present in the language people use. When executives are sharing ideas with the larger organization, they quite often embed their belief systems within their comments. Thesebelief systems are subject to interpretation, and interpretations can vary, leading to misalignment and causing well-intentioned people to exe-cute poorly. === Page 189 === Phase III: Select 169Expressed organizational beliefs typically use the language of needs: •“The solution needs to be funded by organic growth.” •“The fix needs to fit with our current channel model.” •“We cannot create new product offers until the second year of the existing product line.” •“Product Team A’s requirements need to be paramount because they provide the cash to support the other businesses.” Tacit beliefs are typically notions of identity or unwritten rules for how the organization does things: •“We make products—things you can touch, feel, and see.” •“We compete on price.” •“We must do things through the retail channel.” These expressed organizational beliefs and tacit beliefs can represent cri- teria.

Here are some helpful hints forunearthing important beliefs: •List out beliefs as a group, and then deputize members of yourteam to search for any additional beliefs held in the widerorganization. •Ask people open-ended questions. For example: —What gets rewarded around here? By whom? —What is “sacred,” “off-limits,” or “untouchable”? —Similarly, who is “sacred,” “off-limits,” or “untouchable”? —What is worth staking your reputation on? •Ask people to talk about their own experiences. It is also interest-ing to have people express what they believe others think of theirviews, whether they are shared views, heretical, etc. Often this canilluminate hidden issues that less introspective people tend to miss. •Ask questions one on one or in small groups. Find a neutral, pri-vate venue where people can feel comfortable talking. Take ashared walk around the block, or grab lunch at a place not-so-closeto the office so you won’t be constantly checking over yourshoulder for colleagues wandering by. === Page 190 === Chapter 6 170Bringing these criteria to the forefront at the start of the process enables you to fully consider what would be best for the businessbefore the team gets wrapped up in one or two compelling ideas. Bycontrast, when criteria are notmade known and explicit early, people tend to invest in ideas first and then let the ideas drive their criteriaselection later in the process. (“We must pursue this idea!”) There are two tempting simplifications that commonly arise in dealing with success factors. First, people tend to lump all successfactors together and see them as equally important. This is attractivebecause you don’t have to wrestle with ranking the factors. But thisapproach does not help the selection process, so it’s actually a losingmodel. The second simplification is establishing a hard-and-fast ranking. For example, suppose revenue is listed above affinity. A simplisticapproach would resolve all conflicts between the two in favor of rev-enue, when in fact there may be cases where revenue is covered andyou can afford to address affinity. When you’re done with Step 1 of the MurderBoarding framework, you’ll have a clearly identified list of beliefs and criteria. It’s oftentempting to jump the gun at this point and “make the decision.”Don’t do it! Making a decision at this stage will usually take you to asecond-rate option. Instead, it’s important to take",

Step 2: Sort Step 2 of the MurderBoarding framework pushes teams to use thechosen specific, practical criteria to understand the merits of one ideacompared to other ideas. This avoids the problem of “shoot-from-the-hip” final strategy decisions based simply on someone’s “gutinstinct.” Once it’s clear what success will look like and the teamknows what matters to the final strategy selection, they need to testthe options against the criteria, represent the results in a coherentway, and sort the options into buckets (“strong,” “possible,” “weak”)based on how they measure up against each other. In this way, the === Page 191 === Phase III: Select 171team can identify which subset of ideas they need to stop pursuing (kill) and which ones they need to explore further (Figure 6-5). Newcomers to the sorting step sometimes have trouble getting a sense of how much is enough and how much is too much. To clarify, a deeperexample is worth pursuing here. In this case, a team looking at geo-graphic market expansion came up with criteria for what success wouldlook like when establishing a presence in another country. The teamdeveloped this list based on what they knew about their previous suc-cesses in other vertical markets. For them, going global meant having: •Different types of buying options (enterprise licensing, shrink-wrap, etc.) •The right channel in place •Dedicated headcount •Budget requirements that fit within the parameter of revenue/expense ratio •A product that worked in the local language •An online store where people from that country could buy theproductFigure 6-5. Step 2 of the MurderBoarding framework: Sort === Page 192 === Chapter 6 172In the sorting step, the team needed to test options against the criteria. In our example, the options were the different countriesunder consideration. The team evaluated each country by the criteriajust listed and built a thorough description of the current landscape,shown in Figure 6-6. Sorting together will result in everyone knowing why one thing is more important than another. This picture drove the next level of questions and decisions. Theteam believed that some countries that appeared similar could be dis-tinguished with the addition of one or two well-chosen criteria. Aftersome discussion and data gathering, they added these two criteria: •Country sales leadership’s readiness to commit to increasedquota in exchange for investment •Acceptable expected level of in-country piracy After the facts were gathered,",

Regions such as North America and Japanalready had nearly all of the criteria in place. Some countries had littleFigure 6-6. Doing the first sort === Page 193 === Phase III: Select 173investment in place to support vertical expansion, and conversations with the heads of those regions were marked by enthusiasm andinterest. They were willing to commit to growth targets in exchangefor incremental dollars. The qualitative discussions with the heads ofthe regions gave the team a clear understanding of the current stateand enabled some early decisions. Unsurprisingly, surfacing the criteria early in this process helped make sure people were, in fact, making decisions based on identifiedcriteria. The sorting process involved many people bringing differentpoints of view and understanding what mattered to the business. Fil-tering through these points of view brought up more discussionitems, which ultimately led to revisiting and revising the criteria thatdrove their decision: •Use the proven model they had already created for North Amer-ica. Don’t customize for each country. •Drive revenue in relationship to the investment made. Somecountries could be more expensive, and there had to be some“fairness” in the way investment dollars were allocated. •Focus on “easy wins” first so each dollar invested brought maxi-mum gains. •Go global quickly to prevent competitors from winning chosenverticals first. Speed matters. The reason you do all this as an open exercise with the team is forshared understanding. By explicitly naming criteria, then sorting, thenidentifying the reasoning, everyone involved knows why something is considered important. This is crucial in building an organization ofco-thinkers and collaborators. Sorting often drives more fact gathering, such as identifying which teams wouldn’t sign up to a bigger quota in exchange for additionalresources. When different options impact different parts of the orga-nization differently, the sorting process can spark trade-offs and bar-tering. Basically, this amounts to negotiating within the organization for additional criteria and rethinking “facts,” such as how much addi-tional investment is appropriate. In our example, the team then summa-rized the results of the sorting step into a table that reflected their nextlevel of alignment (see Table 6-1). === Page 194 === Chapter 6 174The sorting step gives you a set of options clearly ranked in terms of your criteria.

And if they had even more dollars, they coulddo market development. Options were both ranked (top to bottom)and named with an action so the business leaders could see the avail-able choices. Take a moment to consider that the sorting step does not merely pro- duce a document. It has a profound impact on the team in the form of a deep and shared understanding of what is at stake. The next step, Test, will involve discussions by many team members throughout thelarger organization.

The question for Step 3 is: how do you avoid gettingcompletely bogged down by the challenges you uncover? You mayunearth the unexpected, which is why many organizations hesitate to“test” before pulling the trigger.

During organizational testing, you’ll uncover opera-tional points of view that didn’t arise during the generation of ideas,but will be vitally important for the final step of the four-part Selectphase, Choose. The key benefit to organizational testing is that it forces you to think cross-functionally. It helps you avoid the kinds of problems thatoccur when any business unit or functional area optimizes for theirown needs. We’ve all seen business problems where marketing cre-ates demand at such a high volume that operations can’t deliver, andthen the company’s brand is negatively affected by this poor cus-tomer experience. This comes out of siloed behavior, though itdoesn’t mean that all silos are bad. Silos can be efficient when situa-tions are stable, and everyone can focus on their task without beingdistracted by activities elsewhere. But when it’s time for change, silosare one reason why organizations can make poor strategy choices. Strategy fails when the keys to making a strategy operational cross- functionally are not uncovered soon enough. So by doing organiza-tional testing, you are surveying other parts of the business that couldbe affected, to see whether a strategy can be implemented or to betterunderstand how the strategy would play out and affect those otherbusiness areas. The kinds of questions you want to ask during organizational testing are typically at the operational level. Does our supply chain supportthis? Did we think about the implications to our IT team? How willwe merge our existing pipeline? Does some piece of this new strategyconflict with existing contractual obligations? Do we have what weneed to provide product support in this new region? Each conversa- tion uncovers more data: more details, more criteria for success, and more obstacles. This new information that is uncovered will result inoptions being improved or dropped from consideration. Organizational testing cuts across silos to see what the company can do when working effectively as a whole. === Page 197 === Phase III: Select 177Imagine, for example, that a team decides that the right thing to do to enable their next level of growth is to expand into Asia.

In fact, reshaping good ideas based on new information is sovital that Google, a company known for allowing many to innovate,includes it as one of 18 principles baked into the company model. Jonathan Rosenberg, Google’s SVP of Product Management and Marketing, recently spoke to his alma mater, Claremont McKennaCollege (CMC), and had this to say about reshaping ideas: The next big idea is to morph ideas…. I’ve talked about how dif- ferent inventions come on, and we don’t foresee their real economicimpact for some time: the transistor; the laser; the VCR. I also talkedabout the steam engine, which was originally developed for pumpingwater out of flooding mines, and once you connected it to the rail-roads, basically you tamed the west. There are all of these technolo-gies that are proposed as point solutions to very narrow problems.Figure 6-9. Details of reshaping ideas === Page 200 === Chapter 6 180What we have today is fast change with the underlying technology: the CPU power, the storage requirements. You’re constantly revis-iting ideas that didn’t work before and reapplying them. Blogs wereoriginally about publishing information so that people could reachniche communities. But the whole blog systems that we developed arenow the engines behind publishing information in Google docs andspreadsheets, which is the next evolution for those of you who areusing Gmail. 2 The philosophy and approach that Jonathan describes for product reinvention is exactly what happens during Step 3 of MurderBoarding.As you learn more, you go back to original ideas to morph them. Youblend many ideas together, or you take one part of one idea and mergeDecoding You need to decode what people mean and understand the nuances of options so you can tune, fix, toss, or merge them. There are five com-mon elements of decoding: • Disambiguation . Often a term may mean different things to differ- ent groups. Localization means one thing to Software Development and another to Fulfillment. Disambiguation means eliminatingfuzziness in speaking or writing so that everyone will understandit in the same way. • Distinctiveness. Shave the fluff off an idea so that its unique, par-ticular information is distinctly called out. • Segmentation. Often ideas are nested within a larger item, but tofully understand the flavors of any idea, it needs to be broken intodifferent parts. • Tossing variants. Narrow",

Customization is a big term, and custom-izing a website is different from customizing a physical package. Ifyou care about only one of these, be sure to exclude what youdon’t mean. • Restatement. As a conversational tool for testing, restatement canhelp make sure the situation is well defined. Have you ever had aconversation with someone where you thought you both weretalking about the same thing, only to later realize you each meantsomething entirely different? Restating an idea is a way touncover these potential misunderstandings before they causeproblems. === Page 201 === Phase III: Select 181it with another. The final picture may not look like any one element that entered the process, but that’s perfectly all right. It should be noted that as you refine ideas, you can decide to fix part of an idea or not. By making these refine/fix decisions as a team, youwill not only make more informed decisions, but you will also elimi-nate doubt for many people within the organization when they latermake interdependent decisions. For example, a team expandingfrom consumer software to enterprise selling may uncover that theirordering systems are not set up to handle enterprise-wide order pro-cessing. Instead of killing the idea, they may simply decide not to fixthis problem. They may decide that instead of investing in a $50M ITsystem, they will outsource the order processing for enterprise deals. By contrast, a team wanting to do business globally may discover through its finance department that they are legally required to set upa separate entity to process local currency. The team may decide toinvest in this separate entity because notdoing it is a deal-breaker for the idea, and the idea is compelling enough to justify the investment.The point here is that trade-offs are an essential part of this tuning,fixing, tossing, and merging process. Eliminating doubt allows for the freedom and speed to move forward rapidly. The beauty of this process of tuning, fixing, tossing, and merging isthat once an idea is ready for selection, your whole team will know,beyond the shadow of a doubt, that this idea has been made the best itcan be with respect to your organization and your circumstances.Your team will have engaged in the rigorous debate of ideas, tearingthem apart and reassembling them in new configurations, and dis-cussing what works and what doesn’t.

Because MurderBoarding requires a team to test and refine ideas carefully, a particular idea can become so lightweight that it nolonger retains its power. Be sure to ask yourself: Is this idea elegant === Page 202 === Chapter 6 182and powerful in its simplicity? Or is it simply hollow and empty of value? If it feels lightweight, it might have gotten that way becausepeople discarded its challenging aspects in order to avoid debating itscomplexity. Remember that it takes strength to be open to new ideas. It takes courage to rethink ideas that you may have already invested in, or tosign on to a truly powerful new idea. Be sure to stay patient as you testideas in the organization, and try to stay open to altering ideas as youlearn more. Also keep in mind that there may never be enough data.Strategic decisions involve incomplete or changing information, so learnto make a choice given what you know, and identify triggers so that youcan reevaluate if you learn more down the road. Stay as flexible as youcan, and be ready to trim away things that might be good but not great. The output of the organizational testing step is a set of reshaped stra- tegic options with a reasoned understanding of what it will take todeploy each option (resources, people, costs, time, etc.). In addition,Step 3 has the curious extra benefit of creating even more permissionfor people to highlight or appropriately fix any problems when theycome up later. MurderBoarding empowers people to be more respon-sive and avoid the dysfunctional, passive, “it’s not my job” bystanderbehavior. Step 4: Choose Step 4, Choose, is the last and most crucial step of the Murder-Boarding framework and is how you complete the Select phase of theQuEST process. If you have performed MurderBoarding correctly,the right strategy for your situation will be clear to you and yourteam by the time you reach this step. You will know that you have astrategy that meets your explicit goals, and you will have thoroughlyexplored the implications of this strategy throughout your organiza-tion. Everyone will know the reasoning behind why this strategy wasselected over the others and what makes this strategy best.

But choosing is about the survival of the fit-test, and only the absolute fittest. Remember, by choosing what to do, you are also choosing what notto do, allowing the winning options to thrive. Many people wonder what to do with the optionsthat did not get selected. I’ve found that if you refer to “killing”them, it can sometimes cause some backlash. So, don’t kill them.Simply set them aside, for potential future use. Just as it is hard toprune a rose bush when there are flowers blooming, it is hard to makethese decisions. This is because the act of cutting can appear to bedestructive rather than constructive. But the difference between one strategy option and many options is the difference between win-ning and simply being in the game. Reframe MurderBoarding as aconstructive process, and be willing to convince reluctant people. Let’s look at the MurderBoarding framework as a complete picture (Figure 6-10). After performing the multiple steps of MurderBoarding, you’ll have both organizational alignment and organizational commitment.Everybody on the team will be able and willing to state what thestrategy is and how the key criteria explain why that strategy waschosen. That’s incredibly powerful, and it also requires that ourresponsibilities be clear. Figure 6-10 . MurderBoarding overview === Page 204 === Chapter 6 184Select Roles and Responsibilities It’s important that everybody knows the key parts of their roles. Table 6-2 illustrates your main responsibilities in the Select phase, aswell as those of your team. To be sure, during the process of developing a new strategy, you will see many possible options for addressing your problem. However,choosing the right strategy means selecting one that embodies a single,unified, coherent set of choices. Part of your responsibility is to make sure that everybody is crystal-clear about the reasons the final strategy choice is the right one. It will be farTABLE 6-2.

Take the contra-position on an ideaeveryone supports. For example, “We all love this particular idea, and we’re alreadylooking at ways it can work. If we were to kill this idea, what would it mean?” Or,“We’re all in love with this notion, but before we marry this idea, let’s spend timefiguring out where it would fail.” •Be attentive. Stay present and listen when someone has to let go of an idea he hasbuilt, lobbied for, or worked hard to ideate. Often people will hold on to their “baby”until they believe that you hear them and understand them. Pay attention to people’semotional needs around their ideas and offer your compassion, so that they can feelheard and find a way out of their own gridlock. •Identify what is out, being parked, or being killed. Name it so people can internalizethe decision.

As we’ve covered in differentparts of the QuEST process, openly documenting key decisions iscrucial. Publishing key decisions reinforces the choices made byeveryone who was directly involved in the process, and it signifi-cantly improves the communication with others who were notactively included. The leader’s final role is to “make the call” when needed. If and when your team finds itself at an impasse as to which strategy toselect, it will be your responsibility to make the final decision. Some-times this means that you need to paint a compelling vision for theteam, and sometimes it means that you have to “burn the boat.”Burning the boat means being willing to destroy the precious vehiclethat kept you safe as you crossed uncharted waters.

Most of the time, after traveling through the collaborative strategy process together, you and your team will end up agreeing aboutwhich strategy is best. However, sometimes this is not the case.Either way, the decision about which strategy to pursue is ultimatelyyours to make. Take special care to do this in such a way that every-body on the team understands why the decision is being made. Sequences of Select The newcomer to MurderBoarding may believe that signing on tothis framework will mean endless meetings and “design by com-mittee.” So it might help to know there are also times for one-on-onemeetings and for group deliberations, and certainly a cadence ofmeetings that works to set the pace. The MurderBoarding framework can be applied to many different types of strategies—business, channel, product, market, pricing, etc.—but to describe the flow of forums, let’s walk through an exampleusing the product strategy type. === Page 206 === Chapter 6 186In Step 1, Decide what matters, the product manager sets up some one-on-one meetings with key experts in the business and influentialpeople who have insight into what should shape the strategy criteria.Though these are one-on-one meetings, this stage can happenquickly if planned well. The idea is to have private conversations togather information, anonymize contributors so the issues can be dis-cussed openly (if needed), and then share a document of key find-ings, either as an email or an official report. In Step 2, Sort, the product manager then brings together the involved parties to sort options against criteria and filter them intobuckets. This becomes a way of learning which trajectories could befollowed. This step typically consists of two meetings, and producesa work document that can be reviewed with the business unit head orgeneral manager as appropriate. In Step 3, Test, the product manager or her operational leader pulls together the cross-silo review to do more discovery and shapeoptions. Often this can be done by having the cross-silo staff work1:1, to understand what can be done and what is needed. Then, theyreport on those findings to the decision makers, who shape the stra-tegic options based on what the organization is willing or unwillingto do. In Step 4, Choose, the operational leader brings together the neces- sary functional heads, typically in an already established forum, suchas a quarterly business review or an exec team staff",

But,unlike what we sometimes fear, it won’t take forever. The Goal: Selecting a Winning Strategy MurderBoarding is about making the best decision as an organiza-tion, for the good of the organization. To manage the inevitablemessiness, here are some guidelines that can help make the wholeprocess proceed more smoothly and effectively: •Keep the end in mind. The goal is to select the one powerful,inclusive, and complete strategy and kill off the others, so thatthe one gets the attention it needs to thrive. Remind people ofthis end goal as often as you need to. •Be time-conscious. Allow reasonable time for people to come upwith ideas and criteria, but be quick to cut off discussions thatrehash closed topics. Discourage deep investigations into issuesthat won’t matter much either way. Notice when the new ideashave slowed or stopped entering the conversation, like when thepopcorn is done popping. Maintain the message: we need to dothe full process. And remember that you need to do it quickly, orpeople get into the mindset that collaboration really isn’t worththe time investment. •Set the ground rules. Since this process is about the best ideawinning, ask people to agree to let go of personal ownership ofideas, political games, or wishing-it-were-true. Ask them to enterthe exercise with an honest intellect and clear vision. Encouragethem to",

Especially when probingthe depths of team beliefs, feel free to let people contribute orvote anonymously if you believe it will help the team be morecandid. •Move the nonviable (recently killed) ideas to a physical list, wiki,or other container (away from the main list) that you can comeback to later. Since certain people may be attached to ideas that === Page 209 === Phase III: Select 189they worked hard to propose, putting these ideas in a “place” reassures them that their ideas are being shelved for now instead of being left for dead. This often allows people to move on to the nexttask at hand. This list is also useful to have as a reference, becauseoccasionally you will find that a rejected idea resurfaces as a win-ner after it is revisited and refined, or when the business environ-ment changes over time. •Merge/build new ideas. Use the talent of your group to tune yourideas to your specific situation or come up with new variations(optimized to your outcomes). The idea isn’t to kill one another’sideas, but rather to build on one another’s ideas. •Turn over lots of rocks. Test your ideas with other people. Tooffset your closeness to your own situation, request that outsidecolleagues be your audience as you frame the options. Ask themto roleplay people in your eventual key audience and invite themto test your thinking. Encourage them to ask you “zinger” ques-tions. This is an opportunity to test your thinking once again. •Make the call. Choose the best alternative and say it out loud.Build your muscle for saying “this matters more than that.” •We’ll talk about how to handle conflict in these discussions inAppendix A. It’s very important to know how to make use ofand manage tension in these discussions. The beauty of the MurderBoarding process is that once you select a best idea and implement it, you will be able to reach newgoals. Over time, selecting and developing new ideas will allowyour organization to coalesce around a business focus as strate-gies cluster and gain momentum (Figure 6-11). Of course, thebusiness will constantly flex, and strategies will need to beupdated as the organization responds to market opportunities.You will be able to create the capacity within your organizationto reinvent itself collaboratively from the inside out. •Above all, remember that a strategy is not a strategy until you’ve chosen something.

A strategy that you can’t acton is just a massive anchor holding back your organization’sprogress. === Page 210 === Chapter 6 190Moving On Let’s put to rest the notion that the goal of strategy creation is to get one big win. The ultimate goal is not to win once, but rather to buildboth the capability and capacity that power our organizations to winrepeatedly. In other words, getting strategy right depends on creatingthe conditions that let us outshine our competitors, and to outshinethem on many levels—to out-think them, out-create them, and out-innovate the other players in the market. MurderBoarding plays intothat specifically because it allows you to collaborate organizationally,pick from a relevant set of ideas, and then quickly and efficientlymake decisions in the open. The framework of MurderBoardingallows a whole organization to think and to make tough qualitative decisions, which is the key to winning strategies. The MurderBoarding framework can be challenging, because it is our human nature to resist squashing something that looks viable or isalready in progress. Killing an idea or program with momentum canalso be very difficult to explain and justify. And although many leaderstake the “let’s cut equally” approach in order to share the pain, let’sremember that even though it might be easier to spread the pruningcuts uniformly across the tree, the result would devastate the tree’sFigure 6-11 . When we choose to kill options, we can keep the best ones === Page 211 === Phase III: Select 191ability to bear fruit. It’s the same with business. It’s hard to do selec- tion because it forces clarity, and you will need to make difficulttrade-offs. However, it’s better to do that early, with focused effort,so that downstream results are aligned. Otherwise, your strategy isbased on the hope that decisions made later by others will get youwhere you need to be. You haven’t reached the finish line yet, but you’ve made a lot of progress. Once you’ve done the hard work of the Select phase ofthe collaborative strategy QuEST process, there is still one morephase before execution. The Take phase is about ownership andresponsibility. === Page 213 === Chapter 7CHAPTER 7 Phase IV: Take Some favorite expressions of small children: “It’s not my fault… They made me do it… I forgot.” Some favorite expressions of adults: “It’s not my",

The CEO’s new vision had given us the direc-tion to move from a single-product to a multi-product company. Itwas a big change. Strike that: it was a huge change. I had questions about how the different organizations and teamswould line up to ultimately deliver, but I kept quiet. I thought thenthat “someone else” had it under control, and I wasn’t the only onewho had questions. But everyone charged forward without knowingwho owned what, or which interdependent parts had to be stronglyconnected. Each of us, and the leadership involved, delivered on theparts we individually owned. We did what was on paper as our job description or area of responsibility. The executive team had done what it needed to do at the top of the Air Sandwich, and the doers atthe bottom kept on doing. The sandwich was becoming super-sized! === Page 214 === Chapter 7 194The problem was, we lacked the responsibility for determining how to achieve success across the organization rather than only for our individual components. In effect, we were looking at the middle ofthat Air Sandwich, and each of us was thinking, “This is not the partthat matters to mebecause Idon’t own it” (Figure 7-1). In effect, the middle of the Air Sandwich is the part that no one owns. If no oneowns it, each party is saying that it must be irrelevant, rather thanwhat we actually know by now: that it is absolutely essential. Of course, we know better now. And, oh, the heartache it could have saved if I had known it then. The key issue, of course, is that there was a gap in the way the strategy was formed, which ultimately resulted in strategic companyfailure. Representing a lack of thinking, debate, and understanding, thegapalso results in a lack of shared responsibility. And as long as the gap exists, alignment of downstream activities won’t take place, nomatter how good the people. In Part I of this book, we spent time defining how each of us owns responsibility for participation and engagement. In Part II, we’vetalked about how the QuEST framework enables responsibility andaccountability in each preceding phase.Figure 7-1. The middle of the Air Sandwich",

So at this point, we want to complete the flow of accountability byfocusing on the final phase, where we take ownership of the successof the overall strategy—not just our individual parts. In this phase,we take responsibility for who needs to do what, and identify theinterdependent linkages across silos, people, functions, and so on. The Goal: Taking Ownership The last part of the collaborative strategy process is the Take phase.This is where you translate “The One” strategy idea into action andcome to agreement about who should own what, in clear and mea-surable terms, so that the parties involved know what to do next andcan stay in alignment with each other (Figure 7-2). Figure 7-2. Take is the fourth and final phase of QuEST === Page 216 === Chapter 7 196By the time you’ve arrived at the Take phase, you will already know the “real” problem that needs solving, have solid, viable options cre-ated by people within the organization, and have made the toughchoices based on shared criteria of what success looks like. Implied in all that work is that, by the very way the strategy has been created, the people involved believe in the strategy. People will notonly understand its rationale, they will have internalized the ratio-nale so that they can make important decisions in the field that sup-port the new change. That’s important to call out as a prerequisite tothe Take phase. The Take phase builds on the collaborationthroughout the QuEST process to identify any needed commitments. Take is about people signing up willingly for what they need to do. Avoid the “no one told me, I didn’t agree” excuse. One thing that Take is not is assigning or telling others what they need to do. This can be a subtle distinction, but it’s important thatpeople sign up willingly and are not coerced. This avoids the “no",

The Take phase is all about personal responsibility, so weneed to insist on it to get it. Why Take Is Important The primary goal of this phase is to specify, with as much fidelity aspossible, the accountability and responsibilities of people. It alsoinvolves identifying the interdependencies between players so thathandoffs go smoothly in real time. This includes finding the answersto these questions: •Who has responsibility for what? •What big bucket actions will be required to manifest the strategy? •What are the interdependent tasks/responsibilities/actions? === Page 217 === Phase IV: Take 197•What organizational changes, if any, are needed and where in the organization are they necessary to enable the strategy? •What are the triggers that would alert us if/when a reassessmentis needed, should the strategy not hit the intended target? How to Do It Although the Take phase is not complicated, it does require somecrisp operational work. Imagine, for example, that your team hasdecided to launch a mobile product as a market expansion play. Youand your strategy team have diligently gathered facts, developed solid criteria, creatively generated ideas, and rigorously selected one ideaas your strategy. If you did the process right, you have likely createdthe best strategy given your capabilities. You have arrived at thestrategy that best fits your goals and your specific capabilities as a company. You also know the criteria by which you’ll achieve victory. Identify who/what/interdependencies Now it’s time to sit down with every part of the implementation team(sales, marketing, engineering, customer service, finance, legal)where there are interdependencies, to determine who needs to dowhat to make this strategy a reality. You can do this in small groupsor all at once. Each function or division should address these questions: •What key things do you need to do to make this a reality?

Without such a process, some tacit expectations for whatothers need to do gets lost in translation, and thus a gap is created.We limit these grids to five responsibilities because that’s about asmany as any group can realistically track. If the rest of the processhas gone well, the Take phase goes really quickly because everyone isalready thinking about what they need to do to make the largerstrategy a success, and they likely started to identify interdependen-cies during the Select phase. The Take phase grid can be filled out in a face-to-face working ses- sion, or completed independently by each functional group. Now,you might be wondering why we are asking you to do a templatemodel when earlier we trashed templates. The key here is that you’renot being asked to fill in the blanks. You are being asked to discuss(and then document) key things for each group. There is value inasking each group questions such as, “Do you need anything from engineering?” If the answer is no, then you can confirm, “So you have no dependencies on engineering?” The point is that you want to ulti-mately meet and talk about the action steps, because this discussionirons out the interdependencies between the various functional unitsTABLE 7-1.

The key is not to fill out templates, but to ask questions and discuss key issues that iron out interdependencies. This is also the place for critical negotiations about trade-offs, resource allocation, and agreements that need to be made before youfocus on action (not three months later when the problems start hap-pening). This discussion is essential for the strategy to function prop-erly, and its importance cannot be overemphasized.

This take- ownership system can work in a cascading fashion, so you can fill outthe grid at the VP level, then again at the director level, then at theteam level, and even at the individual level as necessary. There arevarious ways to do this. You can do it interdepartmentally at a lowoperational level and then bubble up, or it can be top-down. But besure no member of the team is saying to themselves, “There’s no waythis is going to happen,” without raising the issue. That is, be surenot to stay locked into VP commits, because if you do, you could beright back in the “6x product expansion in 18 months” situation.When Take is done, the defined actions create a “nesting” effect,which aligns everyone in the organization along the same goals. Itprovides a way to check whether the individual actions (at any level)add up to the expected outcome. Specifics are important because once this list of actions has been agreed to, everyone can get to work. Everyone knows what needs tohappen when, and the focus can now be on execution. In terms ofprogress and status, the roles are clear, the goals have been specified,and at any point in time, anyone can assess how well the strategy isbeing executed. You can keep the strategy alive by using these Takedocuments to review where you are, whether anything in the markethas changed that warrants a review or change, and then tune yourcommitments as needed.

You may find that somepeople need coaching to see the benefits of this system, why it isimportant to be extra-specific when making commitments, and whythis process is important. Explicit and visible commitments drive accountability in the Take phase. === Page 221 === Phase IV: Take 201One thing that I’ve seen teams do is name a “take” item for beliefs/ activities that have to be given up. I’ve seen it work or not work,depending on the culture. For example, if a company is shifting froma mostly services company to a product company, there is a bigchange in how they think about customer requests. In a service com-pany, you say yes to just about anything as long as it’s profitable. In aproduct company, you often want to standardize feature sets, andthat forces a different discipline. In this example, the “what has to begiven up” is custom orders/product customization. I recommend youhave discussions during the Select phase about what you will stopdoing, but if you fear something won’t stick inside the organizationas a key “stop,” you can name and capture that “stop action” here asa major take. At the conclusion of this final phase, you will fully understand: •The actions required to execute the strategy, and who specifically owns them •The interdependent parts of all the moving components •Any beloved beliefs and activities that have to be given up •Budget or resource implications •How the organization will know when it has hit the intended target Take roles and responsibilities To reiterate, the goal of the Take phase is for everyone involved inthe collaborative strategy creation and execution be able to statewhat the strategy is and what critical actions they will need to com-plete to make the strategy a successful reality. By doing this well, weare fixing the “5% know the strategy” issue for your organization. Watch out for the total picture and not just “your part,” because your part is the total picture.

As the effort moves from collaborative strategy creation to col-laborative strategy execution, the leader’s job is to champion thework of the team, making sure that everyone involved understandsthe direction the strategy sets forth and its purpose. Remember, ifyou skip a crucial conversation here, you pay for it later with manymore. Take the time and have the right conversations; this createsalignment and shared responsibilities. For each of us collaborators, this is the time we get to show up to make sure we co-own the success. The Take phase is where therubber meets the road, and every person—from executives to indi-vidual contributors—makes sure things tie together, and then com-mits openly to his or her actions. Table 7-3 lists the leader’s main responsibilities in the Take phase, as well as those of the team. TABLE 7-3. The Take phase roles and responsibilities LEADER’S ROLE •Be sure to involve everyone who is important for making the strategy real. Some of this will take place before the Take phase, but if there are other people who are evenminimally impacted, they need to be brought into the final fold. •Include everyone at this phase; this is not the time for leaving people out of theprocess. If anything, be an over-communicator. •Ask people to discuss key interdependencies and then fill out the responsibility grid.(Again, this is not the same as filling in a template.) •Ask people to commit openly to these deliverables, milestones, and targets. COLLABORATOR’S ROLE •Sign up to the things you need to own. •Make sure you identify interdependencies early and often. Watch out for the totalpicture, not just “yours,” because yours is the total picture. •Know the signals or early signs that can let anyone in the team or business know ifyou’re “off track.” •Openly communicate your and others’ commitments.

This might involve pub-lishing agendas or notes, reiterating commitments at key meetings,or creating some kind of business review (some companies use aquarterly business review) where key decisions and next steps arecommunicated. Make key decisions and next steps specific enough to show who is responsible for fulfilling each commitment. This helps make peopleaccountable to their peers (and perhaps to their bosses), and it enableseffective progress tracking later without to the appearance of micro-managing the effort. Good progress tracking is key to surfacing issuesduring implementation so that those issues get the attention they need.By increasing the transparency of the collaborative strategy as itunfolds, each person is now in the driver’s seat of changing howwork gets done at your company. And because of the way you aredoing these discussions, you are driving a cultural shift in your orga-nization toward shared ownership of success.Managing Temptation: Choosing Your Individual Status over Team Results After having labored so hard during the Select phase, there is a natural tendency to want some personal credit. Some leaders find it hard not towant to pass out cigars and receive personal congratulations. Leaders,you’ll want to resist this temptation because, once again, the organiza-tion and the people involved need to own the strategy and continue feel-ing responsible for every aspect of it. If you fall prey to grandstanding“your achievements” over the team’s contribution, your team will feelbetrayed, devalued, and unmotivated at the crucial moment when theyneed to begin the heavy lifting of implementation. There’s a balance tobe struck between getting acknowledgment for your leadership andstealing the show. === Page 224 === Chapter 7 204The Artifacts of the Take Phase The work of this phase makes resource commitments open and clear, so that any resource issues can be resolved before the plan is in place. Specifically, the Take phase is important because the artifacts: •Create a common vocabulary around what needs to happen and who is doing what •Prompt teams to understand and negotiate the interdependenciesacross divisions or departments •Allow dialogue on how to deliver (instead of why we can’t) byraising obstacles and issues early •Give everyone a process tool to assess whether the strategy is ontrack •Help people be objectively clear on achievement against goals There are two key points to remember about the Take phase (seeFigure 7-3).

Explicit and open commitments are important becausepeople tend to do those things that they have to report on to others. Second, this phase is about specifics. Before everyone forgets what was decided, what needs to be managed, and the reasons for keydecisions, you need to write it down. Be specific about what your milestones are. For example, a statement such as, “When this strategyis successful, we will be playing nice with the product people,” isnot specific. (Which product people? Are there 6 people or 600?Figure 7-3. The Take artifacts === Page 225 === Phase IV: Take 205What does “playing nice” mean?) Specifics are always who, what, when, where, and why, so that everyone understands the milestonesin the same exact way. When you know the specifics, you also knowwhen you need to reevaluate the strategy. Managing Temptations Overall In Chapters 4 through 7, I’ve highlighted the common temptationsyou will find along the way. These temptations are real, and unlessyou are from the planet Krypton and have escaped all human foibles,you will face them. There is no guarantee about whether it’ll all workout, but these tools and process frameworks will certainly help youdo strategy better than you would have in the Air Sandwich days. As we lead this process, we aim for the organization to think strategi- cally. This is a different way of being, and because it involves people,it has its own challenges. We’ve named the issues that will oftenarise, and I want you to remember that these temptations are veryeasy to fall into. Keep in mind that you want to avoid them; it mighthelp to have your colleagues join you and point out that they arehappening in case you get tempted. Both clients and colleagues have used this process to defend them- selves against these alluring temptations so that they can shift towardbetter outcomes. The QuEST process acts like a defense shield in thisway (Figure 7-4). Figure 7-4.

But the New How is the new black. How good you get at it is upto you. Sure, this kind of strategy creation better aligns your team. Equally important, it enhances the effectiveness of the entire organization.Slowly, each person becomes empowered (Figure 7-5) to make deci-sions more independently—decisions that align with larger companyefforts. With their newly expanded perspective, each person becomescapable of making more informed trade-offs and adjustments on the fly as challenges pop up during the execution of collaborative strategy because they “get it.” They see the big picture and they know whatmatters and why.

In Chapter 1, we made the point that most organizations are using out- dated systems that derail effective strategy creation. We looked at thepieces of organizational systems and identified three chunks. Thefirst belongs to the individuals in the organization, which we cov-ered in Part I. The second chunk, process methodology, is shared by the individual and the organization, and we covered that in Part II. It’stime to look at the third chunk of system elements, which belongs moreto the organization than it does to the individuals. If we take a metaphorical perspective, we can view the process cre- ation system as a cathedral. The individuals represent the bricks, andthe process phases are cross-timbers. To build a robust edifice, weobviously need quality bricks and excellent timbers. But we needmore. Something must fill in the cracks between those structural ele-ments and",

Also,it’s best to figure out the other parts of the structure before we try tofigure out how we’re going to glue them together. The mortar fills inthe gaps and the bolts link where we need linking. We’ve done thebig pieces of structure for six chapters, and now we’re down to thelast few crucial parts. Enough said. We won’t hold you up any longer. Let’s move on to how organizations enable collaborative strategy to create winningsolutions. === Page 231 === Chapter 8CHAPTER 8 Collaborating to Win Hell, there are no rules here, we are trying to accomplish something. —Thomas Edison What Makes It Work Inside the Corporation Context Every one of us who has spent time in the workforce has participated in co-creating how business works today. Some of our contributions have been positive, and others have been negative. Sound harsh? Perhaps.But I’m not trying to pick on anyone. (Think back on the stories frommy own experience, and you can understand how that is true for me.)The point is not to judge, but to illustrate a point. Every time an executive asked for participation (“Any questions?”) and we stared at a crack in the ceiling rather than taking on someissue that we were conscious of, we let the culture of poor strategycreation continue. Every time we cut out relevant raw data or sugar-coated the “issues slide” as we passed content to our manager,director, VP, or GM, we let it happen. Whenever we allotted a keyissue insufficient time on a meeting agenda, we let it happen. Our legacy of hierarchical structures and decision making has out- lasted its value, and in doing so has encouraged a culture of failedstrategies. For us to change, we need to change the rules. Part I of === Page 232 === Chapter 8 212this book described how we can promote an inclusive culture of par- ticipation in which each of us steps up and the leaders move frombeing Chiefs of Answers to being cultivators of involvement. We alsotalked about the need to challenge, debate, and create new optionsthat represent a far better range of solutions than would be createdby a few folks in an ivory tower. Part I was about ways of being, and how behaviors and attitudes support collaboration. Of course what we do also matters,",

By providing a way to make the tough, messychoices together, the framework aligns everyone in your organizationon the “why,” so that they in turn can line up substrategies accord-ingly. So Part II was about the doing—the New How. But we’re not 100% there yet. In order to fully enable a New How, we need a few more “contextual elements” broadly embedded in theorganization to glue it together. I call them organizational principles. First Principles of the New How Teams that are consistently successful have a shared set of norms—a unified sense of purpose and a common vision for what they needto do. Through their common rules of working together, they form a“community of purpose,” not just a random clump of people underthe same roof. The community is a unique entity with shared beliefs:a shared purpose, shared values, and a shared approach to winning. The more aligned the community is, the more smoothly they collabo-rate. This is the “forming, storming, norming, performing” sequence that Bruce Tuckman first established. 1 Where does a team get its shared beliefs? For “organically grown”teams, they may develop out of some jumble of the stronger personal-ities of the team’s founding members. Or they may be explicitly “syn- thesized” as part of a scripted team-building exercise. Either way, shared core beliefs help to build trust and allow a team to take riskswith each other and create together. The shared beliefs help to pro-vide a sense of identity while encouraging shared ownership of thework product. Any core set of beliefs is useful to some degree, but === Page 233 === Collaborating to Win 213high-performing teams have core beliefs that align with their respon- sibilities (see Figure 8-1). Through my experience, I have found sev-eral key principles that help collaborative strategy teams becomehigh-performing teams. Although I am introducing these principles near the end of the book, in my mind they are the very foundation of the New How. If youtook the actions discussed in Parts I and II of this book, without alsoapplying these basic principles, you likely wouldn’t be embodyingcollaborative strategy. That is, they are central to how people createand carry out strategy. These principles form",

The principles of collaborative strategy involve five aspects of ashared worldview that everyone adopts if they aim to be part of ahigh-performing collaborative strategy team: Distribute decision making As much as possible, organizations that want to move fast must support decision making closest to the related part of the organiza-tion. Both the number of individual decisions and the bias ofshared decisions should spread throughout the organization. This means that less focus is put on title and level than on the area offocus to drive new growth.Figure 8-1.

Rewards and compensation are predominantly based onthe collective business performance. Set clear goals and then improvise For people to collaborate in creation, they need to have a cleardestination to aim for, and the freedom to create. The leader(CEO/GM) needs to define the destination well enough for oth-ers to aim for it, even when they don’t check in for weeks at atime. Be students of the game We know that teams and people will make mistakes and thatthings change fast in the marketplace. This is reality. We alsoknow that learning organizations get better over time at innova- tion, disruptive change management, and operational excel-lence. We say “whoops,” 2learn from the error, realign to our compass, fix our approach, and keep going because we havework to do. We don’t insist on definite answers; we welcomequestions. We enjoy exploring ideas and weighing the merits ofmultiple options. We like turning over rocks and exploring newfrontiers. We embrace being “students of the game.” These first principles are organizational norms that lead to winningresults. You’d be hard pressed to find a winning company thatdoesn’t embody most, if not all, of these principles in some form,even if they have not explicitly adopted collaborative strategy. All of this is in support of a larger intention, of course. The New How is based on the premise that strategy is not “Strategy” until it hasbecome real. We believe",

A strategy is legitimate onlywhen it is ready to generate results. Let’s dig into all these first principles in more detail. Distribute decision making The first principle is that people are expected to work together so effectively that they can make decisions closer to the source of therelevant action. We don’t make fewer decisions (we might makemore), but we make them where they need to be made. This meansthat we move the locus of control. We don’t approach the world withthe notion of “that’s above (or below) my pay grade.” Similarly, weas execs must not dismiss an activity as beneath us if it is importantto the business, because that models the wrong behavior. Instead,roll up your sleeves and set an example. Strategy creation can happen anywhere in the organization where the talents, information, and wisdom exist to address a particular need.Whenever a decision is needed, the issue is not immediately esca-lated to the top. Instead, the team reaches out locally until it findswhat it needs to make that decision. Ellen’s story (scrubbed of identifying information) in the sidebar “Hey, Wait…Do We Do That?” on page 216 shows how having aprocess for shaping strategies on the fly makes a company moreresponsive to the marketplace. The events in that story took place in2008, and represented a shift in approach for a company aiming towin new markets. If Ellen’s company had adhered to a traditional strategy creation model, Ellen’s pursuit of a new market might have taken six months to a yearor longer. Her time, and that of her colleagues, would have been spenttrying to build consensus and getting approvals rather than inventingon the fly. She would have had to wait for the planning cycle, create abusiness plan, and get high-level sign-off before taking any definitiveaction. Some execs might challenge assumptions or data, and othersmight cleverly take the credit. === Page 236 === Chapter 8 216Hey, Wait…Do We Do That? Ellen’s company delivered PCsupport services.

AlthoughEllen’s company didn’t “do” network management, Ellen knew that thehigher-level strategic goal of her division was to grow the nascent ser-vices business. Ellen assembled a small group of colleagues and direct reports, and then stepped through a logical process framework to explore the potentialopportunity. They evaluated the facts and weighed the options oflaunching a network management services offering. In concert with herteam, Ellen decided that adding these services to the company’s menuwas a good idea. She corralled internal experts, put together an opera-tions plan, trained a group of customer service representatives, and qui-etly piloted the offering so that when customers requested support, thecompany could present this new offering as appropriate. Ellen’s boss, the VP of Global Services, discovered this was happening only when a customer commented that he had tried the company’s newnetwork service and liked it. The VP was a little hesitant to reply, think-ing to himself, “Do we have a network service offering?” But the cus- tomer enthusiastically showed him the support link on the companywebsite. Perhaps Ellen could have communicated earlier or more effectively with her boss, but the point here is that Ellen and her team’s initiative todevelop a new opportunity expanded the market they were serving inalignment with the higher-level strategic goal. Soon, the services busi-ness expanded to become PC and network services. The new offering was profitable almost immediately and helped differentiate the com-pany from its competitors. === Page 237 === Collaborating to Win 217Instead, Ellen used her domain knowledge to create a strategy that fit with the clear mission of the business. She had the roadmap on howto think about the situation. This allowed her to test an idea quicklyand prove its worth in the marketplace (which is more compelling thansurvey results or dubious analyst forecasts), making the company moreresponsive to its customers and therefore more ready to win. Ellen used a process that allowed her to invent on the fly. She and her team had a set of shared core beliefs—beliefs about her role, what herorganization would allow, and what ultimately mattered to her com-pany. These beliefs enabled her to focus on value creation first and approval second. These first principles were the driving force behindher ability to invent. Knowing that her principles were shared withthe larger team, Ellen had the permission she needed",

Stepping back from Ellen’s story, it’s important to note that eachcompany will have their own mix ratio. One firm might have 90% ofthe decisions approved by the C-Suite, but could be better served bya number like 70%. Another might be at 70% today and benefit bymoving to 50%. You and your organization must look at the kinds ofdecisions you face and consider where they need to be made.This story is a classic example of effective collaborative strategy. Ellen was empowered to respond to what customers were telling her, and shewas empowered to find and engage with the right people to experimentand try new ideas. Ellen didn’t need to prove that a network servicesmarket existed or check in with many layers of executives to see whatshe was allowed to do. How much time would have been wasted if shehad taken that approach? Instead, she simply saw what looked like anopportunity, understood that it was aligned with the larger strategicgoal, vetted the idea with people close to the action, and then took theinitiative to test it—ultimately shaping the future of the company. === Page 238 === Chapter 8 218Demand good followership Strategy conversations are creative discussions.

When we sign up for collaborative strategy, part of the price of admission is to support the judgment calls of thosewho carry that responsibility. Because in the end, there will still bejudgment calls. Is there a 10% chance or a 40% chance that theproduct team will miss the date for the key deliverable? What arethe odds our competitors will announce a product in this space inthe next 12 months? How quickly will buyers switch to/from ourproduct if X? Sometimes the judgment comes down to: we can do X or we can do Y, but we don’t have the resources to do both. Ideally, there is a clearconsensus decision, but sometimes not. As a part of Murder-Boarding, our pet project may get shelved or tossed. This isn’t fun,but it is necessary. On any messy decision, it will not be clear what is “right” or “wrong”(that’s what makes it messy), and the person leading will need tomake the call. Some days, that could be you; other days, it’s someoneelse. If you have done the process right and heard everyone out andvetted the ideas, then you need to buy in on the decision. The key tocollaborative strategy working is that you decide to have the fairdebate and let your voice be heard to shape the outcomes, but whenit comes time to make the call, you align behind the leader.

How about an improv session at a comedyclub? The difference between traditional strategy and collaborativestrategy is like the difference between these two performances. At the symphony, the more exactly a performance matches the director’s vision, the more perfect it is. Flawless execution occurswhen each talented performer performs precisely as practiced underthe meticulous attention of the maestro. Rehearsal is essential andvirtuoso skill with the instrument is valued, but deliberate deviationfrom the score is taboo. In stark contrast, improv has a very different performance process. The group’s players improvise and play off each other to create thepiece, building on what others have created with a “yes, and…” style.The performance is less scripted, and the process of creation is fluid.In improvisational art, collaboration is unique, built on high engage-ment, and allows individuals to contribute something to the largerwhole. Each performance has common themes, but is unique to thesituation at hand. In both types of performance art, the players bringtheir unique talents, but they use different methods to “create” theperformance.

Your goal inthese cases is not so much “get it right” but “get the ball furtherdown the field” and learn in the process. As such, you invite eachother to play with ideas and try different things as part of the cre-ative process. Experimentation searches for useful ideas that can be built upon and incrementally improved. A question like, “What about that ideacould work?” is inviting and provocative. Taking this approach promptsothers to share their ideas, insights, or points of view so that theycan be blended into a larger understanding of what everyone knows. === Page 244 === Chapter 8 224Inquisition favors the status quo by searching for flaws and putting the burden of proof on new ideas. Questions like, “Why do you thinkthat will work?” are intimidating, and no answer seems adequate.It’s hard to know even where to begin!

Let’s use experimentation andinnovation language instead. It helps bring out our unique points ofview. One is open and creates new options, whereas the other showsoff what one knows but not what one can create. Collaborative strategy is a creative act that depends on the ideas of many people throughout the organization. Because collaborativestrategy places significant value on what might be possible versuswhat is certainly true, the nature of the conversations around ideasand feasibility matter deeply. Codes of conduct support us to offerup insights, remote associations, and clever concepts so we can co-create with many different people, regardless of status and titles. involve others. In discovering what is possible, who does the talking and who does the listening are just as important as the conversationsthat take place.

She needed to do a pilotfirst, see what happened, and then tune the approach. The conversa-tions with marketing went round and round. She felt the traditionalbusiness was being old school. They felt she was being demanding andflaky. Both parties seemed to want to work with each other, but the rela-tionships were getting strained. The conversation became heated around an end-cap retail display stand. Sabrina saw one in the lobby of the company, and wanted to see if thatmight work for her product, so she sent one of her people to find out if thevendor could do a prototype. This kicked off a whole series of meetingsaround the requirements, whether it would go nationwide or interna-tional, which languages were needed so that legal could weigh in, andmore. Sabrina’s quick experiment turned into a missile program. She wasready to bypass the company altogether and have her 17-year-old son whipup a prototype in their garage over the weekend. Sabrina thought her problem was the end-cap stand. It wasn’t. Sabrina’s problem was that she and the people she was working with wanted incom-patible things. The existing company players wanted to follow proper pro-cedures so that the product could scale and to avoid surprises. Theywanted to minimize risk. But for Sabrina, risk wasn’t even part of the pic-ture. She simply wanted to play with ideas, because she couldn’t knowwhat she wanted until she saw what worked. Sabrina needed to experi-ment, but she was trapped in a process-oriented culture that had no way to deal with experimentation. Both parties were so enmeshed in their points of view that they never realized they had skipped a crucial conversation about what each sideneeded. Consequently, they had not identified the core issue, and thatleft them wrestling with the details instead of proposing ways to balancetheir fundamental differences. === Page 247 === Collaborating to Win 227TABLE 8-3.

Agreeing on the rules of the game is essential because the process of creating strategy does not come with a standard board we can look atand easily wrap our brains around. While strategy creation requiresall the smarts—from data, insights, and models—to achieve results,it must also involve working intimately with human beings and theirideas. To get their insight and creativity and enthusiastic contribu-tions, we need them to enjoy being in the game. We covered five first principles earlier in this chapter. They span a range of how culture gets shaped within an organization via power,people, change, decision making, process, and idea generation. Eachof these areas comes into play during collaborative strategy creation,and we need shared understanding of the code of conduct to simplymanage them. Otherwise, we get unnecessary conflict, confusion, andthe erosion of a shared sense of purpose. So take those principles andmake them your own, and embed them in your organizations. Becausewhen companies have good, shared bedrock principles, they establishthe foundation for a culture that fosters and reinforces winning. You might recall from Chapter 1 that strategies fail for many reasons that have to do with how people relate to one another, respond tochange, make decisions, and generate and share new ideas. We canchange our systems to fix those things, and we’ve now covered all === Page 250 === Chapter 8 230three parts of that change: how people act and behave, how people do the work of strategy creation, and the first principles that organi-zations need to share. Imagine what can happen if you and your colleagues work in this collaborative environment. For most of you, strategy creation andstrategy execution would look very different. People with positionalpower would no longer drive the company in arbitrary directions,ignorant of what really works. Leaders in high places would nolonger make ill-advised unilateral decisions on how to deal with sig-nificant challenges facing the organization, and then drop the newdirection like a bomb on the company at large. There would be nosilent majority aware of a different “truth,” knowing the new planwon’t work and quietly making side bets on when the trainwreck willoccur. People wouldn’t have to sit and wait for umpteen levels ofmanagement approval to pursue a new idea, watching as competi-tors steal the match. Instead, we can move to a place",

Let’s party on. === Page 251 === Epilogue: It’s What We Make of It Throughout this book, I’ve shared the ways business can improve, how we reinvent work together, and how collaboration in the form ofco-creating business solutions can fundamentally improve outcomes.Let me share with you now the backstory of why I believe what Ibelieve. I was in my final quarter of graduate school, feeling ready to be done with the tightrope act between working and studies, when I got theassignment that transformed my perspective of how business works. Standing regally at the podium, my white-haired professor, Andre Delbecq, dean of management studies, gave us our last assignment:study a tree, reflect on how this tree relates to business and leader-ship, and then write an essay about it. And, no, it wasn’t a joke.“Easy A, here I come!” I thought, already picturing how this cake-walk assignment would free up the necessary time to focus on mymore important paper, an HBR case study about how companystrengths are manifested in business outcomes. Though I considered the tree assignment a waste of time, I went through the motions, diligently studying a large oak tree near myhome. I’d been staring at that tree for some minutes when I suddenlyrealized: the tree essay and my case study work represented the same darn thing. (Wouldn’t ya know it, I learned something after all?) === Page 252 === Epilogue 232What (I asked myself) is the basis of a tree? The roots and the trunk. Sure, the leaves and the fruit are the eye-catching bits that come tomind when we think of a tree. They are what my six-year-old son willsketch if you ask him to draw you a tree. Yet the enduring elementsthat survive the storms and winter frost are the unsung roots andtrunk, which produce and nourish the leaves and the fruit. The parallel in business became clear to me: companies often focus their attention on the eye-catching business results of profits andstock price (the leaves and",

In both cases, it’s the unseen and unsung parts that drive thefundamental health, growth, and results of the system. Just as rootsderive nutrients from the soil, so businesses draw upon ideas to feedgrowth; as the trunk supports and defines the tree shape, so peopleinnovate and set direction for the company. When you prune thebranches judiciously, making tough decisions to make room forfuture growth, the trunk will support the branches that bear fruit,and nutrients will go to all the right places. As I studied that tree, I realized how simple it was.All the complicated and sophisticated models I’d been learning in business school and applying inside notable companies were, bythemselves, not enough to create success. The models and analysismissed the very basics of what created strong business outcomes. Theroots of the tree represent the individual team members in business. To harness the power of ideas, you need people to capture them, debate them, and shape them into the substance of competitive advantages.People are the roots that enable organizations to thrive. Just as a single root can feed a tree, any one person can prompt a business to reinvent. Change begins with the actions and attitudes ofpeople like you—driven people, looking to tackle challenges—whochoose to work in a new way, creating a New How. We feed andwater the tree, or in this case, our organizations. We make thechoices to pursue results that support the health of our companies. The idea that any or each of us can reinvent business to work better is both daunting and inspiring. But anyone who has picked up this bookand studied its contents this far is plainly interested in driving changeand adopting new approaches that create more winning outcomes. === Page 253 === Epilogue 233There is much to do; where do we begin? Well, we begin as we already have, by understanding what is possible. What comes nextdepends on you and your situation. But it is about taking action(Figure E-1), as cultures and companies change when any one shifthappens. Most of my career has been about problem solving and creating win- ning strategies. I also have a growing passion for understanding whatcan enable the people in organizations—people like you and me—toimprove how business works. That passion has driven me to developthe tools and practices that fill this book. So, this book",

I’ve shared this approach with you not merely so we can achieve better business results, but because it can create better work environmentswhere people can rise above and thrive. I want everyone to step uptheir game, bring their full abilities to work, and stop abdicatingresponsibility to “the other guy.” I want companies to thrive becausethey are able to come up with great new directions and make them realin the marketplace.

Still, many of the ideas in this book developed gradually in my mind over the last 20 years, so writing it has been a clarifying view of what makes me believe these ways work. This book emerged from a conversation with Harry Max in early November 2007. Having recently joined my Rubicon team, Harryand I were talking about my approach to strategy development,which I see as a deeply creative act—one that not only focuses onbusiness concepts, frameworks, and ideas, but also the processthrough which strategies are formed, shaped, chosen, and made realby people. Harry had recently written “the book” on how DreamWorks Anima- tion collaborates internally in creating films. He raised this question:did successful business strategy really involve the same kind of creativeacts as film",

Building successful strategies is deeply creative, and it’s when we blend the what with the how andthe who that success is more likely to manifest. But this idea had a genesis long before my high-techcareer. These beliefs were ingrained in me early. In 1987, as a com-munity college student trustee, I was unexpectedly selected by mychancellor, Tom Fryer, to be given a seat at the table hashing out thefuture of the California community college system for a piece ofreform legislation called AB 1725. === Page 256 === Acknowledgments 236Tom was a notable national leader in shared governance, so everyone in the room—the governor, legislators, faculty leaders,and me—participated as equals. It was a completely collaborativeeffort. Each time we had a policy decision to make, Tom would puttogether a three-inch-thick binder of notes, articles, and opinions weneeded to read the week before the meeting, then follow up with aphone call. He wanted to know my opinions, along with everyoneelse’s. He wanted to know my thoughts and the ideas his materialshad sparked. I was 30 years younger than Tom, but he spoke to meas an equal, and I worked hard to have an opinion worthy of hisattention. We each had responsibilities. We were deeply accountablefor having and holding opinions and of course for achieving results.Because it was something we were jointly creating, none of us wouldhave “credit,” but we would all end up having great pride in the workwe did. Tom once explained his methods at a meeting, and I was lucky enough to find the file that held those notes: When we, as the administration, don’t talk to faculty and students as equal members, they see themselves as passive participants and vic-tims of the decisions of the administration. As a result, they don’tunderstand the decisions, or feel like the decisions are theirs, and theywon’t contribute themselves to the effort. Our community doesn’texist until everybody creates something together. Looking back on that experience, I can see the thread of my own story, and why I believe that collaboration and shared governancecan create that elusive “buy-in” that every organization seeks as itinnovates and sets direction. It’s when we co-own the outcome ofsuccess together that we co-create that future of success. In my 20 years since those community college days, I’ve participated with nonprofits, educational institutions, and,",

Yet most of us don’t take a collaborative approach.From that, I draw the conclusion that we don’t work collaborativelybecause we don’t know how. It’s not a lack of will, but a lack of way. Finding that way has been a learned thing. Not surprisingly, it’s been a process of both successes and failures that have led to the clarity I === Page 257 === Acknowledgments 237have today.

But don’t share this guide if you think it willtempt people to give “prepared” answers, or consult others forthe “right” answers. 3.Doing interviews with two interviewers (i.e., two-on-one) allowsone person to focus on listening and note-taking. If you use thisapproach, the note-taker/listener should keep a relatively lowprofile to encourage the interviewee to speak freely. Interviewing alone is better if you expect delicate or risky topics to come up. If, in a two-on-one interview, you get the sense that the intervieweeis holding back, consider rescheduling a one-on-one interview. 4.Spend a moment at the beginning of the interview to let peopleknow that their information is valuable, and it will not be usedto get anyone in “hot water.” 5.Start with a warm-up question that is open-ended and allowspeople to state their point of view. Typically, people need 5–10minutes to get their brains engaged on the topic at hand. 6.Start the interview with the easier topics first. Leave more sensi-tive issues for later. 7.Don’t ask too much. Ask one question at a time. Go slowly. Thespeed at which you ask questions can signal to the intervieweewhether you are more concerned about your own agenda ormore interested in his point of view. 8.Simplify questions to keep learning and discovery focused onsmall pieces of the problem. Exploring smaller pieces allows youto see the nuances of the problem. 9.Briefly paraphrase what you’ve heard from your interviewee toaffirm your understanding and so they can correct you in themoment. 10.When interviewing, be sure to listen, not lead. Focus on learn-ing, not demonstrating your intelligence. === Page 261 === Tools 24111.Use an indirect approach. Ask “What bothers you most?” (instead of “When do you hate your job?”). 12.Use a “Colombo” tactic: act dumb but keep probing. 13.Show respect for what people can contribute. People at all levelshave something to contribute. 14.Always send thank-you notes. You may find that you need thehelp of your interviewees later, and courtesies such as thank-younotes go a long way toward making people feel acknowledged andappreciated. Building a Findings Framework Building a findings framework gives you a way to create a snapshotview of the current situation, so people can begin to understand theissues. Intention The purpose of a finding framework is to help you organize whatyou’ve learned and synthesize it, so you can report it",

Approach 1.Organize all your findings. 2.Take a day and reread everything. Invest the time. 3.Then, using an outline format, ask yourself: a.What did I learn? b.What do I believe to be true or not? c.What are the implications? 4.Make a list of the key points of your findings. 5.Seek at least three supporting references or data points for eachkey point. Make sure they are distinct, and yet capture the com-prehensive situation. === Page 262 === Appendix A 2426.Review your sources. Check to be sure they are solid and that you have documented them (subject to confidentiality). Identifythe gaps and where you need additional info. 7.Talk with additional people if you need to fill in the gaps. Speaking Truth with Clarity and Power Conversations about “the state of the state” should not be focused onpushing information at people; they are about getting people to rec-ognize what is happening in the current situation. Your goal in theseconversations is to inform people about what you see, why you see itthat way, how you feel, what you believe to be true, and what youbelieve is important for them to understand. The following tips helpyou speak about the truth clearly and powerfully. Intention When speaking truth, it is very important to leave room for people tothink their own thoughts and have their own understandings. Wordslike “respect” and “dignity” are useful in this context to remindpeople that honoring differences and perspectives is necessary fordriving change. The words you use, the tone you use, and the con-text you set will all make a difference in how others respond. Approach 1.Start with what matters most, and set the context for what youwant. This can sound like: “For me, what I most want to do is tocreate a shared understanding….” Sharing what is important toyou may seem like common sense, but without it, people do notknow your intention. It is not enough to know your intention;you must communicate it to the group. 2.Say exactly and specifically what you want people to under-stand. Use as many distinctions as needed. It is not enough todescribe something as “blue” if what you really mean is “tur-quoise.” Don’t rely on subtext. Don’t expect them to “figure itout.” You are responsible for calling a spade a spade. Useproof points when you",

For example, “I believe the issue isturquoise because of these three points of fact….” === Page 263 === Tools 2433.Present everything as “early findings,” not truth. The word “truth” has a charge to it. The phrase “early findings” suggestsyou are doing good discovery and your observations are for theteam to understand together. 4.Avoid easing in. The work of Chris Argyris has introduced thisconcept of “easing in,” which is where you try and soften a mes-sage by delivering it indirectly through hints and leading ques-tions. Easing in conveys that you have a point of view you areunwilling to share directly, which suggests that the issue isembarrassing or shameful. A better approach is to make the sub-ject clear and discussable by stating your thoughts straight outand indicating that you are interested in working on solving thesituation. 5.Avoid using the word “you” when you are about to critiquesomething. Rather than saying, “Your ideas are unclear,” youcan say, “I need more clarity on those ideas.” You can state yourperceptions, feelings, and assumptions, but you should not stateother people’s assumptions and feelings. 6.Remember that people will take in different pieces of informa-tion at different speeds and in different ways. You want to thinkabout presenting findings at a summary level and at a specificlevel, with both qualitative and quantitative facts. Look for waysto paint a picture or use an analogy. 7.Ask people to comment on what they see differently and why.Remember the goal is a shared understanding. You want tomake sure everyone sees things fully and expansively (versusagreeing). Clarity and understanding is what you seek. Tips for Criteria Development When a team has a “feeling” for what they want, but cannot expressthis feeling clearly in words, these exercises can be helpful. Theyreveal tacit beliefs and perceptions, and elicit criteria that will ulti-mately help the team select a winning strategy. === Page 264 === Appendix A 244Intention The purpose of criteria development is to surface tacit assumptions about what matters, so the organization can know why one thing ismore important than something else. Being explicit about assump-tions allows you to test them and challenge them as a group. Approach Exercise #1: Imagining the future This exercise allows a team to dream, but without having to “own”the wording or the grandness. •Have each person write ideas on Post-its and submit them into apile. •One idea per Post-it.

Exercise #2: Developing competencies This exercise looks at competitors for ideas about where a team canexcel. •Have each person write ideas on Post-its and submit them into apile. •One idea per Post-it. The Post-its must all be the same color. •Guiding questions (preface each with “Compared to ourcompetitors…”): —What do we do well? —What don’t we do so well? === Page 265 === Tools 245—What could we do differently (e.g., technologies, culture, partnerships)? —What do we have that we never want to let go of? —What do we love about what we have (e.g., ease of use,fraud management, underdog status, brand power)? Exercise #3: Exploring new models This exercise1looks at parallel industries to brainstorm ideas about what could be emulated. For example, do we want to deliver likeFedEx? Design like BMW? •Have each person write ideas on Post-its and submit them into apile. •One idea per Post-it. The Post-its must all be the same color. •Guiding questions: —What are 10 companies you admire? —Why do you admire them? —What things would you like to see our company do as wellas another company? Generating Options Brainstorming is a great way to generate options and ideas. During thebrainstorming process, you need to give free rein to people’s cre-ativity and avoid criticism. Criticism can hamper creativity. Intention The purpose of generating options is to make sure you have freshalternatives to today’s problems and that you are pulling theseoptions from an expansive pool of ideas. Approach 1.Clearly define the problem to be solved, as explicitly, concretely,and politically incorrectly as you can. Lay out the criteria to bemet. The best problem statements focus outward on a specificcustomer need or market-facing goal, rather than inward on === Page 266 === Appendix A 246some organizational view. For example, “We want to serve our mid-market customers with a new online service” is better than,“Our division has to grow by 20%.” Keep the session focused onthe problem you want to solve. 2.Have ground rules. Just like a great game, you need to knowhow to play. Some sample ground rules are: —Defer your judgment. —Turn off all electronic distractions (phones and computers). —Don’t",

The best facilitators nurture the conversation in itsearly stages so that the session allows people to start generatingideas and helps people find their groove. Make sure that no trainof thought is followed for too long, because people start to checkout. You want to manage the flow but not over-engineer it. Changethe pace if you want to change the outcomes. If people are stuck,have them do something different: get them to work together orapart, outside or inside, at the whiteboard or at their desks. 4.Introduce inspiration. No team can come up with stuff out of theblue, so a good way of spurring really great and inspiring ideas isto introduce a new element. A book, a speaker, or some “home-work” to get fresh points of view are all useful. As the leader, youinfluence the team’s ideas by what you put in front of them.Speakers can be someone within the company or out; books can beon point or far afield (hint: children’s books can spur great ideas). 5.Make a record. People can be very fearful of losing an idea if it isnot in writing. Knowing that it’s being captured frees people up tofocus on idea generation. Appoint one person to note down ideasthat come out of the session. Avoid the temptation to evaluate theideas during the session, and remind people the session is forcreating, not critiquing. === Page 267 === Tools 247Burning the Boat Burning the boat is about creating a compelling reason for people to move on and incentives for them to adopt a new direction. The term itself comes from Thucydides, in his History of the Peloponnesian War – Book III,2written about the solution one general came up with in ancient Greece: “…burning their boats so as to have no hope exceptin becoming masters of the country.” This legendary military deci-sion eliminated all possibility of retreat. The troops knew there wasno way out but through, and they performed because the situationleft no alternative. Intention Burning the boat is about setting a new direction and rewarding allactions that support that new direction. It is an all-or-nothingapproach that must be chosen with care. Approach Specify the destination The team needs to know what the new destination is and how toget there. How you communicate the new direction will mattersignificantly in whether you get there.

Announce the new move and makesure there is a specific launch date or even an event that willcause the team to remember that a large change has occurred. Make the move necessary There must be a penalty for clinging to the old. For example, thepoint of demarcation between the old and the new might be achange in procedure, such as people will not be able to get intothe building without the new identification badges. The changeshould be marked by tangible and intangible elements so thatthere is reinforcement of the change. === Page 268 === Appendix A 248Create a crisis I recently had an executive bring in a high-priced consultant to tell her board why the current business was limiting growth. Theexecutive needed a third party to carry the message and signalloudly that the old business didn’t support the future directionof the company. Employees understood the seriousness of thechange because they saw “the suits” walking around holdingmeetings. Talk about the new With every meeting, there should be a conversation thatacknowledges and brings the new direction into focus. You haveto reiterate how important the new direction is to bringing inrevenue and to the future of the company. Relate the new direc-tion to current operations. Spend time talking about the new. As aleader, you will signal to your team what’s important to you (con-sciously or unconsciously) by how much time you spend on thenew direction. Tune in and talk about it, and your team will, too. Only hire in the new focus Look for people that match the new direction. Make sure thateach new hire extends your reach into the new space by provid-ing knowledge and capabilities that will help you get whereyou’re going. Reward people based on the new focus Compensation can sharpen performance. Salespeople in particu-lar have an amazing ability to focus on their compensation plan. Use the plan to guide behavior so that your company reaps therewards and gets the kinds of results you wanted when you firstdetermined what the new direction would be. Dismantle the old infrastructure Don’t continue to support the old business. If you’ve decided tolet go of a product line, consider selling it, renaming it, or other-wise getting the point across that things have changed in a fun-damental way. Don’t feed the old systems by providing them alarge slice of the budget, mentioning them in company-widemeetings, or including them in",

Winning too much : The need to win at all co sts and in all situations. 2. Adding too much value : The overwhelming desire to a dd our 2 cents to every discussion. 3. Passing judgment : The need to rate others and impose our standards on them. 4. Making destructive comments : The needless sarcasm and cu tting remarks that we think make us witty. 5. Starting with NO, BUT, HOWEVER : The overuse of these negative qualifiers which secretly say to everyone that I’m right and you’re wrong. 6. Telling the world how smart we are : The need to show people we’re smarter than they think we are. 7. Speaking when angry : Using emotional volatility as a management tool. 8. Negativity, or “Let me explain why that won’t work”: The need to share our negative thoughts even when we weren’t asked. 9. Withholding information : The refusal to share informa tion in order to maintain an advantage over others. 10. Failing to give proper recognition : The inability to give praise and reward. 11. Claiming credit that that we don’t deserve : The most annoying way to overestimate our contribution to any success. 12. Making excuses : The need to reposition our annoying behavior as a permanent fixture so people excuse us for it. 13. Clinging to the past : The need to deflect blame away from ourselves and onto events and people from our past; a subset of blaming everyone else. 14. Playing favorites : Failing to see that we are treating someone unfairly. 15. Refusing to express regret : The inability to take responsibility for our actions, admit we’re wrong, or recognize how our actions affect others. 16. Not listening : The most passive-aggressive form of disrespect for colleagues. 17. Failing to express gratitude : The most basic form of bad manners. 18. Punishing the messenger : The misguided need to attack the innocent who are usually only trying to help us. 19. Passing the buck : The need to blame everyone but ourselves. 20. An excessive need to be “me” : Exalting our faults as virtue s simply because they’re who we are. Source: © 2007 Marshall Goldsmith, What Got You Here Won’t Get You There , Page 40-41 Hyperion Books.

Sample Footer Text 20XX 27 === Slide 28 === confidence A lot of people think having confidence is important, but it’s not. Confidence is actually quite overrated. “Lack of confidence” is often used as an excuse for inaction. Lacking confidence will not stop someone from taking appropriate action unless they let it. When you apply the “radical self-honesty distinction” to the “inaction due to the lack of confidence” excuse, the excuse will simply not hold up. Take someone with extreme stage fright. He says he would rather be dead than to get up and speak before an audience of a hundred people. But tell him that he will not be allowed to see his darling little three-year-old daughter until he gives a speech to a thousand people and he will knock people out of the way to get up on stage. Confidence may or may not be present for you, but that’s okay as long as you are living from an inner stance of responsible leadership, which will produce appropriate decisive action. In essence, a leader is someone who is willing to come from any inner stance necessary to get the job done.

The difference between the two groups lies in accountability. True story: Early in the Minnesota Twins 2009 exhibition season, Twins manager Ron Gardenhire discovered a noteon his desk from Justin Morneau, his star ﬁrst baseman. Itread: ‘‘Gardy: I forgot to run sprints after the workoutsyesterday; I am ﬁning myself.’’ Next to the note was a hundred-dollar bill. Was Justin Morneau accountable because he was a su- perstar, or was he a superstar because he was accountable? No More Excuses is a way of looking at the world—a standard to which we hold ourselves and others account-able. It’s a strategy for life and work that attracts others to us, because accountability is a universal trait of admiredpeople. ix === Page 12 === E1FLAST02 11/14/2009 10:50:28 Page 10 No More Excuses is not a slogan. It is a competitive choice. Whether you are trying to hold onto your job or expand your enterprise, whether you are trying to create a new business relationship or improve your communicationwith key stakeholders, or whether you are trying to ﬁnd anew customer or retain a major client, you will always ﬁndthat personal accountability differentiates you from your competition and give you the competitive edge. Account- ability is not a consequence. In order for it to become yourcompetitive advantage, you must be willing to change whatyou expect from yourself and others. No More Excuses is all about closing the gap between where we are and where we could be as individuals and as organizations. We can do this by learning and applying, on a personal level, the ﬁve critical principles that supportan expanding Accountability Zone that has us at the verycenter. In this book, I will challenge you to expand your own Accountability Zone by embracing what I call the FiveAccountabilities: Right things : Be accountable for doing the right things. This means ethical execution of the activities that willactually support the goals you have chosen for yourself. If you are managing a team, you must model this skill by doing the right things yourself; you must then empowereach member of your team to identify his or her own rightthings, and you must be willing to communicate aboutwhat’s working and what isn’t in an open, transparent way at all times.

This means being willing to step away from things that are working, even though they may befamiliar, to make room for something that may work better.Introduction: Your Competitive Advantage x === Page 13 === E1FLAST02 11/14/2009 10:50:28 Page 11 Yes, this is a risk, but it’s one that successful people take— because the return can be positive for the whole enterprise. Managing your space takes time and practice. Force of habit causes us to repeat many behaviors and initiativesthat aren’t what we really want. Process: Be accountable for managing the process when you hit an obstacle. It is inevitable that you will encounteradversities and setbacks when you pursue your goals. Thequestion is, how will the adversities and setbacks affectyou? Will they keep you from making creative newapproaches to attain your goal?Transparency Means Being Accountable for Doing the Right Things—from the Top Down Organizational governance systems are like machines,and the only oil that actually makes these machineswork is the oil of conﬁdence. To generate conﬁdenceand trust, you need transparency. If there is no trans- parency, there is no trust. If there is no trust, the basic architecture of any company just falls down rightaway. —Jordi Canals Redefine Your Space! If you had the exact same dollars today that you didback then, and knowing what you know now, would you jump into this opportunity or a different one? —Jeff BoothIntroduction: Your Competitive Advantage xi === Page 14 === E1FLAST02 11/14/2009 10:50:28 Page 12 Expectations: Be accountable for establishing the right expectations. The targets you set for yourself will have a huge impact on your actual achievement. How will you set the targets for yourself and your team? Will you set thembased on what is familiar or what is possible? Will you setthem too high, too low, or in that ideal zone where the goalis a healthy stretch? Relationships: Be accountable for your relationships and your contributions to them. The human touch in anyrelationship is the ‘‘lubricant’’ that makes communicationpossible and empowers individuals, groups, and organiza-tions to accomplish great things. Without accountability forHow Will You Respond?

When you are accountable for supporting and contribu- ting to your relationships, you are acknowledging thatthere is no such thing as ‘‘group accountability’’—there is only the accountability of one person to another. These are the ﬁve pillars of personal accountability that make organizational accountability possible. I believe that every truly meaningful achievement and every great orga-nization starts with an individual who has established a personal Accountability Zone—a place where the transpar-ency is high, the values are clear, and the commitment tothe Five Accountabilities is unmistakable. These Five Accountabilities are your responsibility be- fore they are anyone else’s. What’s more, they are scalable:It’s Really about Relationships A corporation really is a collection of people. It is ajoint mission to accomplish something in a business.The way an organization or a household works, theway a community works—it’s really about relation-ships, and the real measure of any leader is the ability to leverage relationships to inﬂuence others to em- brace accountability. You can only do that by givingsomething to your relationships and supporting themover time. —Peter AcetoIntroduction: Your Competitive Advantage xiii === Page 16 === E1FLAST02 11/14/2009 10:50:28 Page 14 They can affect and enhance virtually all aspects of your life, as well as the lives of people you touch.

Accountability means being in the position of trulyowning all that an organization believes in, stands for,and promises to deliver. Everybody had better be inthat position—not just the CEO. The CEO can only deliver on the big picture if the other people in the organization deliver on their pieces of the picture. Atthe end of the day, everyone is responsible to eachother for executing on the larger vision. —Nido QubeinIntroduction: Your Competitive Advantage xiv === Page 17 === E1FLAST02 11/14/2009 10:50:28 Page 15 You’re going to be hearing a lot about strategic intent in this book. Your strategic intent is the driving, overriding goal that motivates and inspires you. It’s the goal that everyone gets—not the tactics that support that goal.(Those tactics are your right things.) Strategic intent is going to the moon for the ﬁrst time and getting back safely;it’s launching a startup that creates a whole new industry by winning 100,000 new customers in its ﬁrst year; it’s making $250,000 in personal income for the year, whenyou’ve never done that before. Strategic intent is a big goal that’s easy to understand and buy into. Know Your Strategic Intent I created Dean’s Beans about 16 years ago for onereason: to model how a for-proﬁt business could be apositive player in social change and still be proﬁtable.That was my strategic intent. So, we were accountablefor that social change, whether it was environmental, economic, or social. It was not relegated to the world of the nonproﬁts. I realized that nonproﬁts werealways asking businesses to give them money, sothey could keep going. I made myself accountablefor changing the model. I thought, ‘‘It’s [the] business’sresponsibility to behave in a way that doesn’t damage the earth, the people, [and] the societies in it so that eventually, we can reach a point where those non-proﬁts may never have to exist.’’ Proving that con-cept’s viability became my own commitment. —Dean CyconIntroduction: Your Competitive Advantage xv === Page 18 === E1FLAST02 11/14/2009 10:50:28 Page 16 When you are in the Accountability Zone, you encourage open dialogue and discussion rather than sealing yourself off from it.

This engagement may be a little job you can Accountable to a Nation In our case, we were accountable for creating a newconstitution for a post-apartheid South Africa. That meant starting from scratch, disengaging from every- thing in the old space, and starting a responsible,transparent dialogue that somehow incorporatedthe views not of a tiny elite [group] but of 42 millionpeople. That dialogue wasn’t about revising what hadgone before; it was more about liquidating the previ- ous dispensation and replacing it with [a] completely new idea. We had to liquidate the old company as itexisted, scrap it and bring it down to zero, and fromthat create a new environment with a completely newstructure. We had to create a new paradigm based on a completely new set of values that would replace an old paradigm that had been in place for 350 years. —Roelf MeyerIntroduction: Your Competitive Advantage xvi === Page 19 === E1FLAST02 11/14/2009 10:50:28 Page 17 do on your own, or it may be something you have to get some help with.

This is a seemingly small decision that inevitably echoes larger and becomes more destabilizing over time. When I’m working with organizations to create a culture of accountability, my clients will sometimes ask: ‘‘How dowe create an Accountability Zone?’’ I think it’s more a matter of knowing when you leftit. Your own private Account- ability Zone is always there waiting for you. Here’s a quick and easy test you can perform at both the personal andorganizational level: If there’s no alignment, if there’s noengagement, if there’s no strategic intent, if there’s notransparency—guess what? You just left your Account- ability Zone! A better question than ‘‘How do I create an Accountabil- ity Zone?’’ is: ‘‘How do I expand an Accountability Zone?’’ And the answer is, by making the Five Accountabilities apart of your daily life. In over 30 years of owning busi- nesses, observing people, speaking professionally, and writing, I’ve found the Five Accountabilities covered inthis book to be the most powerful tools for personal andorganizational growth available. I suspected that the FiveAccountabilities I had identiﬁed were already serving as anchors in the lives of the most successful people and organizations on earth. I interviewed dozens of high achiev-ers from around the world and found that they, too, hadbeen using most or all of these principles to create Ac-countability Zones for themselves and their organizations. Some of the people I interviewed had mastered the Five Accountabilities quickly in life, almost by instinct; forothers, it took years of personal experience and plentyof trial and error to master the principles.

He wanted to check on my availability to speak at his organization’s annual lead- ership conference. My assistant checked the calendar, saw that the date in question was open, and booked the date. Wemailed out our standard agreement, and the client signedand returned it. A couple of weeks later, I realized that a few of my personal commitments had somehow never made it onto my business calendar: little things like my anniversary, spring vacation with my family—and my daughter Jackie’shigh school graduation! No problem, I thought. We’ll just put all the missing items on the calendar. When we did, we noticed something interesting. I was supposed to speak at that favored client’s leader- ship conference in Washington, D.C., at 8:00 on Friday morning, the eighteenth of May. As it turned out, mydaughter Jackie’s graduation was in St. Louis on the 3 === Page 32 === E1C01 11/14/2009 10:7:18 Page 4 previous night . The ceremony started at 7:30 P.M. and wouldn’t be over until past 9:30 P.M. When I realized that I had a family commitment on the evening of the seven- teenth and a speaking date on the morning of the eigh-teenth, my stomach started to churn. I’m a frequent ﬂyer,and frequent ﬂiers who live in St. Louis know that the onlyway out of our fair city after 7:00 P.M. on a Thursday is on a donkey . . . and a donkey deﬁnitely wasn’t going to getme to D.C. by Friday morning. I called my client. Here’s what I said: ‘‘Sal? Hi, Sam Silverstein. How’s it going? Good, good. Hey, you knowthat program in May? Listen, I kind of double-bookedmyself up against my daughter’s graduation. Is there any chance I could speak in the afternoon on Friday or ﬁrst thing Saturday?’’ There was a pause.Then Sal said, ‘‘Sam, let me get clear on something. Your program iscalled ‘No More Excuses,’ right?’’ Now I knew I had a problem. Quickly, I pondered my options. Theoretically—only theoretically, mind you—Icould call in sick at the last minute and ask another speakerto come ﬁll in for me.",

Yes, it was. Option number two: I could miss my daughter’s gradua- tion. I started thinking to myself, Well, she is my third child . . . Then I stopped myself. My stomach started feel- ing funny all over again. Seriously: There had to be someother answer. I started calling charter companies to inquire about a ﬂight.No More Excuses 4 === Page 33 === E1C01 11/14/2009 10:7:18 Page 5 The lowest bidder to get me from St. Louis after gradua- tion to Washington, D.C., in time for my speech was $10,000. I now had a $10,000 question: What am I accountable for—and to whom? Was I going to pick one commitment over the other, or was I going to write the check? Every time I thoughtabout letting one or the other of those commitments slide, I thought about the guy who’d be looking back at me fromthe bathroom mirror each morning, and I knew I was goingto have to face that guy. I wrote the check. At about 9:30 P.M. on Thursday the seventeenth, I watched my daughter walk across the stage, with her head held high and a smile that could light up North America, to receive her diploma. At 10:15 P.M., it was wheels up in a little charter plane that might as well havebeen called ‘‘Spirit of St. Louis.’’ It was a turbulent takeoff. In fact, I remember thinking to myself, Maybe I shouldn’t have gone with the low-cost bidder. But the ride smoothed out nicely, and by about 2:15 A.M., I was tucked away safely between the lily-whites in my hotel room in Washington. I got a couple of hours ofshut-eye and made the speech that morning, which was very well received. In fact, I got a standing ovation. (By the way, the rumor that I made Jackie start her summer job the very next day to help defray the cost of the jet fuel is completely without foundation.) Here’s the point. My $10,000 question wasn’t just about Jackie and my client. Ultimately, I realized I had to beaccountable to myself ﬁrst in this situation. I had to ﬁnd a way to follow through on both commitments I had made— for them, yes, but for me ﬁrst. I didn’t want to be the kindThe",

Often, as this story illustrates, it takes self-discipline to live our life with ethics, morality, and integrity. Yes, in doing so there will be some late ﬂights and some large billsif you hold yourself accountable. But accepting all of thosechallenges beats the alternative: making excuses. That’s exactly what I would have been doing if I had gone back on either of those commitments: making an excuse to myself ﬁrst—telling a story, buying it, and then passing thatstory on to someone else. I believe that it is only by learning to hold ourselves accountable, by taking a pass on the inevitable opportuni-ties we get to feed ourselves excuses, that we can achieve the end results we are seeking in life. Eventually, we all face our own version of what I call the $10,000 question. That question isn’t really about whatkind of ﬂight you take from St. Louis to Washington, D.C. It’s about what kind of person you are and what kind of organization you are willing to create by holding yourselfaccountable ﬁrst and encouraging others to do the same.A Personal Matter Accountability is a really deep, personal driver. Eventhough I believe others can remind you about it andpoint you toward it, and even though I have certainlyhad mentors that have done that, I think at the end ofthe day, it is really up to each individual to make accountability happen. —David SnivelyNo More Excuses 6 === Page 35 === E1C01 11/14/2009 10:7:18 Page 7 It’s about launching your own global No More Excuses movement by expanding your own Accountability Zone. You have to be the ﬁrst occupant of that zone, and you have to get very good at stepping back into it once younotice you’ve strayed from it. Once you’ve perfected theart of returning to the Accountability Zone as an individ-ual, you’ve taken the essential ﬁrst step toward organiza- tional accountability and responsibility. Individual Integrity, Organizational Integrity Any discussion of organizational ethics begins with individual accountability, because we all eventuallyhave to pay the consequences when individuals arenot accountable to themselves ﬁrst.

I also believe that our ﬁrst account-ability is to the person we see in the bathroom mirror each morning. No, it’s not always easy for us to start there, but it is the very best place for us to start, and it’s much, muchbetter to start with accountability to ourselves than it is tostart with an excuse. Ultimately, accountability comes down to choices, the only things we truly own. Everything else that we think weown can be taken away—our home, our cars, all of ourpossessions. Even the people we know and love can leaveus. At the end of the day, the only thing that will remain willbe the choices we have made. To get the most out of this book, make choices, not excuses, about how to implement and practice whatyou encounter here. Conscious choices are the opposite of excuses; they are one of the hallmarks of an excuse-free life.(continued ) in failures of personal accountability. That’s what made the organizational problems possible: people who weren’t accountable to themselves. We allhave to be willing to step back and say, ‘‘You knowwhat?

They think it could be the spouse; it couldbe the prime minister; it could be the president or the mayor or somebody else who is really responsible. Other people may be responsible for making somedecisions that affect us, but ultimately, we are theones who are responsible for how we respond andhow we react.

We must learn to move beyond excuses. The number one reason people succeed in their personal and professionallife is that they don’t make or accept excuses. Successful people know that failure is part of the success process. However, they don’t use excuses to justify failure, and they don’t let others around them get away with excuses, either. Leaders are accountable. Leaders admit fault. Leaders do not make excuses. Accountability Means Walking the Walk You’ve got to walk the walk, and people have to seeyou walking the walk. If you’re going to be account-able as a leader, you’ve got to spend some time communicating with all of your constituencies. It has got to be interactive.

Supposedly, after the youngWashington cut down a cherry tree, his father approachedhim and demanded, ‘‘Who chopped down the cherry tree?’’We’re told that Washington responded, ‘‘I cannot tell a lie—it was I who chopped down the cherry tree!’’ That’s accountability. There are absolutely no excuses in that response, which may be one of the reasons thestory has remained so important to us over the years.Unfortunately, it’s a story that a lot of our politiciansdon’t seem to have grasped. Do you get the feeling that if a politician got in trouble over a cherry tree today, an excuse or two might creep intothe equation? I do. In fact, we have a special name forpeople whose job it is to come up with excuses for politi-cians. We call them spin doctors.has to say and take the hard questions and give themtruthful answers. You have got to be willing to say, ‘‘You know what? That’s a good question. I don’t know the answer, though. I’m going to ﬁnd out, and Iam going to get back to you.’’ —George TamkeThe $10,000 Question 11 === Page 40 === E1C01 11/14/2009 10:7:18 Page 12 Imagine a president being interviewed today about that same incident. ‘‘Mr. President, did you cut down the cherry tree?’’ ‘‘Well, yes, and no. It’s a complex issue. You see, I couldn’t have ‘cut it down,’ because cutting is actuallysomething one does with a knife. You can ‘cut’ a ﬁnger,but you can’t really ‘cut’ a tree. And since I used my hatchet, the relationship I had with the tree was really not a ‘cutting’ relationship. Personally, I would call it more of a choppingrelationship. And obviously, I didn’t cut the cherry tree‘down,’ because, as you can see, the cherry tree’s stump isstill standing. Now, since that stump is clearly a part ofthe tree, saying that I ‘cut down’ the cherry tree becomes yet another example of the bitter partisan rhetoric that is poisoning our whole political culture.

But here’s the question: Do we ever letother people get away with them? Do we ever let our- selves get away with them? I’m talking about the excuses we use to get ourselves off the hook, deny personal responsibility, and spin our own actions so that we can try to manipulate ourselves and other people to accept our own bull. In the end, excuses are what we use to deny our own personal accountability. And people are ﬁnally beginningNo More Excuses 12 === Page 41 === E1C01 11/14/2009 10:7:18 Page 13 to realize that denying personal accountability is always at the root of organizational accountability problems. WHAT ACCOUNTABILITY REALLY MEANS Accountability means . . . being accountable to ourselves.This is where we should start but usually don’t. Account-ability to ourselves is what happens when we decide wewon’t violate our own values, and we resolve to hold our-selves accountable to those values. When I had to choosewhat to do about Jackie’s graduation, I had to ﬁnd a way toA New Scrutiny on Accountability In my lifetime, there has been a huge increase in therequirements for accountability, and here, I mean itin the sense of being answerable. This includes thetransparency with which things are done within anyorganization and the need to report in an open way. Taking two high-proﬁle examples, all the expense claims (including receipts or lack of them) of UKMembers of Parliament have been published. As aresult, a number have resigned; others have beenforced out as some of their more outrageous claimshave been exposed.

You already have examples of this kind of accountabil- ity in your own life, too. For instance, if you ever had the opportunity to cheat on a test and chose not to, even though no one was looking and you knew you could getaway with it, you were holding yourself accountable toyour own standards. If you had the opportunity to padyour expense report, but you didn’t do that because youdidn’t want to be the kind of person who cheats on an expense report, you were holding yourself accountable to your own standards. The question I have for you is this: How often do you hold yourself accountable to your own standards duringthe average day? Probably more than you think. Don’t sell yourself short. If you’ve ever chosen not to cheat on your diet, even though you could have done so, you know whatpersonal accountability is. If you’ve ever made a commit- ment to yourself to get a physical examination from yourdoctor once a year and followed through on that commit- ment, you know what personal accountability is. You are already a resident of your own Accountability Zone. Yourjob now is to make that zone a bigger and more habitualpart of your life. Highly accountable leaders don’t simply impose accountabilities on the members of their team. Theyspecialize in learning exactly what has to happen for anindividual to hold himself or herself accountable for attaining a given goal. Yes, this means modeling self-accountability, but it means a lot more than that.No More Excuses 14 === Page 43 === E1C01 11/14/2009 10:7:18 Page 15 When You Love People, They Become More Accountable I believe it is our responsibility to help people achieve their own accountability to themselves.

This is where we usually start. That’s not a bad thing—in fact, it’s essential to be accountable to others. When we make commitments to other people, we have to honor those commitments, but if you’re not true to your own values, you’re eventually going to ﬁnd it impossible tobe true to your commitment to someone else. We musteach be the ﬁrst occupant of our own Accountability Zone. Which is usually easier for us: Taking action to fulﬁll a commitment because we’re committed to our own values or taking action because we’re afraid of what someone else would think? If you’re like most of the people I talk to,you’ll admit that the opinions of others sometimes play alarger role in motivating you than your own values do. Are we really more worried about what others think of us than what we think of ourselves? Accountability means . . . understanding commit- ments others have made to us. People may give us excuses. In fact, we may have trained them to give us excuses, based on what we have shown we are willing totolerate in the past. This type of accountability can be very difﬁcult if we’re trying to make ‘‘No More Excuses’’ thedriving reality in our lives. We can’t buy someone’s excuse and stay in our own Accountability",

Of course, that is not always easy. For example, I got a haircut a few months back. The place where I go is a one-man shop that’s run by a very nice guy named Bill. I arrived at 9:55 A.M. for a 10:00 A.M. appointment, and the door was locked. Bill didn’t show up until 10:30 A.M. As he unlocked the door, he said, ‘‘I’m sorry that I’m late. I got a ticket on the way to work.’’ Have you ever heard that one about the ticket before? How do you respond to that? Do you show sympathy and compassion? Or, do you look for the real issue and thenﬁnd an appropriate way to call the person on it? It’s easy just to join in the pity party. It’s easy to think, ‘‘Hey, he got a ticket, cut him some slack.’’ Sometimes wemay choose to do that. We should know, however, that each time we buy an excuse at face value, we leave the Ac-countability Zone. At least half of the time when people let their account- ability to us slip away, they’re selling us an excuse aboutsomething that really happened and hoping we’ll buy itwithout noticing that it didn’t really have anything to dowith their failure to deliver what they’ve committed to. I suspected that Bill was going to be late regardless of whether he got a ticket but simply didn’t mention that part. Was he planning to walk in the door at 10:00 A.M.? Wouldn’t it have made more sense to plan to walk in the door at 9:45 A.M., or 9:30 A.M., to get ready for the day, just in case something unexpected happened? The easy way out is to let people who make excuses off the hook—to buy the excuse. But amazing things can happen when you choose not to buy.The $10,000 Question 17 === Page 46 === E1C01 11/14/2009 10:7:19 Page 18 I looked at Bill and said, ‘‘I know you got a ticket, but you also left late, didn’t you?’’ He",

This time he didn’t say a word ashe unlocked the door. You see, Bill realized that I didn’twant to hear his stories, because his issues are his prob- lems, and they are not my problems. Together, we were building a shared Accountability Zone. After my haircut, as I was on the way out, Bill said, ‘‘Sam, next month I will be standing here waiting for you.’’ Andhe was. Bill became a better businessman, and I becamea better customer, because he chose to move beyond the excuses. Would we have gotten the same outcome if I had simply bought his initial excuse about the ticket and accepted his poor planning as my problem? Think twice before you buy or sell an excuse. When you accept an excuse from someone who’s made a commit-ment to you, you take on that person’s problem. Don’t letsomeone else’s problems become yours, and don’t try toofﬂoad your problems on anyone else. Accountability means . . . helping others stay account- able to themselves. This is what happens when people help each other to become more self-accountable. It’s part ofwhat I call an Accountability Circle: a group where eachperson has the implied right to help someone else in thegroup do a better job of maintaining commitments to themselves. This group is also known as a Mastermind Group. I think everyone should have a group like this. Noneof us is perfect. Just as we all need a pat on the back fromtime to time, we all need reinforcement when it comes tocreating zones of accountability.No More Excuses 18 === Page 47 === E1C01 11/14/2009 10:7:19 Page 19 I originally got involved with a Mastermind Group because I thought it was a great way to share ideas and solve problems. I saw it as an opportunity to leverage someone else’s experience. What I didn’t realize is thatthere was another, much bigger beneﬁt from the Master-mind Group. It was this: After discussing issues at one ofour meetings, each of us would invariably make choices and commit to taking a speciﬁc action prior to our next meeting. Coming to the next meeting and not havingcompleted the tasks you’d committed to was simply notacceptable. This was not a ‘‘support group.’’ It was a choice group: a place where people went",

For more information on Mastermind Groups, go to www.SamSilverstein.com. Our accountability to ourselves makes the other three kinds of accountability possible. It is impossible to create anAccountability Zone in your life without establishing self-accountability. This kind of accountability, I believe, is a prerequisite for all meaningful achievement with the team. Four hundred years ago, William Shakespeare wrote these words: ‘‘This above all: to thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, though canst not thenbe false to any man’’ ( Hamlet, I, ll.¶78–80).

By looking at those words with fresh eyes, by internalizingThe $10,000 Question 19 === Page 48 === E1C01 11/14/2009 10:7:19 Page 20 them, we may ﬁnd that we have come up against an important opportunity to grow as people. When we are accountable to ourselves ﬁrst, when we honor our own values, we really will ﬁnd it a great dealeasier to make and keep commitments for which we canbe accountable to others. We’ll get better at only makingthe commitments we can actually keep, and we’ll do a better job of following through on those commitments. When we are accountable to ourselves ﬁrst and foremost, we will ﬁnd it’s much easier to have productive exchanges with people about areas where there’s a gap between whatthey’ve promised and what they’ve delivered. Last but not least, when we are accountable to ourselves ﬁrst, we will be a better model and a better resource forthe people who look to us for help in building up their ownaccountability ‘‘muscle’’ and creating their own Account-ability Zones.

In this chapter, we look more closely at the habit of selling our- selves excuses and learn why that habit is too expensive. There are at least three negative outcomes when it comes to using and accepting excuses. Let’s look at them. Consequences Culturally, we have drifted away from accountability in this country for at least the last generation andperhaps longer. The consequences have been moredire than most people realize. —Richard Chambers 23 === Page 52 === E1C02 11/14/2009 10:9:23 Page 24 EXCUSES WEAKEN US AS PEOPLE I believe that excuses make us weaker as people, regard- less of whether we’re giving the excuses or accepting them. Giving or accepting an excuse is a choice, and choicesalways have consequences. Often, the consequence is thatwe get addicted to excuse making. Have you ever noticed that the most successful people in life do not make very many excuses in the areas that matter most to them nor tolerate many excuses? Have you ever noticed that the least successful people in life make a whole lot of excuses and that some of them make a habit ofaccepting the excuses of others more or less at face value?Do you think that behavior pattern is a coincidence? In my experience, I have learned that weak people—by that I mean, people who are not trying to get the most from themselves—are usually people who are hooked on excuses. Donald Trump is successful in business, not justbecause of his business savvy and not just because of his family’s history in the real estate industry. He’s also successfulbecause his personal commitments actually mean some-thing. And you know what else? Another reason he’ssuccessful is that he surrounds himself with responsiblepeople, and he doesn’t tolerate excuses from them. Until we can stand up, live our life responsibly, and expect the same responsibility from others that we demandof ourselves; until we are willing to draw a line in the sandwhen it comes to both giving and receiving excuses andto commit to staying on the right side of",

They inevitably gain strength by making that admission. Weak people, on the other hand, usually try to attach fault for a problem to someone or somethingoutside of their control, and they always seem to become alittle weaker as a result.

On the other hand, don’t you loserespect for people who deny responsibility for problemsthat are clearly theirs? And don’t those people look andsound stupid when they’re in excuse mode? It is powerful to admit fault without offering a big excuse story, but we rarely hear people do this. We rarely hearpeople say, ‘‘Yes boss, I was late, and it won’t happen again.’’‘‘Yes ofﬁcer, I was speeding, and I deserve a ticket.’’‘‘Yes senator, I sold energy to California for exaggerated prices and absconded with shareholder money.’’ That’s not what we hear.

We have a right to be sick of it. We’ve heard ‘‘It’s not my fault’’ for far too long.

We have to accept that excuses only make us weaker as individuals, as organizations, as a nation, and as a species on this planet. And we have to be willing to stop making and accepting excuses in our own life. Are we really losing all that much when we commit to stop making excuses? I don’t think so. The main thing I can see that we’re losing out on is the opportunity to look andsound just as stupid as all the excuse-makers out there.This opportunity to distinguish ourselves is something we should actually be grateful for, because the act of making excuses makes us look stupid—and you can’t ﬁx stupid. A motorist once explained the reason she got into an accident in the following unforgettable words: As I ap- proached the intersection, a sign suddenly appeared in a place where no sign had ever appeared before, making me unable to avoid the accident. Do we really want to be known as the kind of person who comes up with that sort of lame excuse? I don’t think so. I believe we each have a responsibility to be proactively accountable in what we do. That means we stop spending time and energy making excuses for what has happened inthe past, and we start building ourselves and others up aspeople by making clear commitments for what we will bedelivering in the future. Reactive accountability is about managing the past. When you manage the past, you are unable to create thepresent or future you desire. To live a prosperous presentand create an ideal future, you must use proactive account-ability. It is only through proactive accountability that youNo More Excuses 26 === Page 55 === E1C02 11/14/2009 10:9:23 Page 27 take control of what you should really be focused on and insure that you achieve what you desire in the future. Just saying ‘‘my bad’’ without drawing any conclusions about what should take place in the future is reactive ac-countability. That is the sound of weakness. Proactiveaccountability uses the past as a guide and establishesexactly what we are committing to from this point forward. For instance, if we had avoided the temptation to blame trafﬁc signs and instead stopped risky behaviors like talk-ing on the cell phone while we were driving, that wouldhave been an example of proactive accountability.

A lot of the people who dobuild their lives around giving and accepting excuses are thepeople who are working for our competition. Let’s facefacts: It doesn’t take all that much to distinguish ourselves from these people. &If you show up, you’re in the top 25 percent. That’s ifyou just show up! &If you show up with a plan, you’re in the top 15 percent. &If you show up with a plan and you work that plan, you’re in the top 10 percent. &If you show up with a plan, work that plan, don’t make excuses, and are proactively accountable, you’re in thetop 5 percent. From there, you can succeed in almostanything you do. Learn to stop making and accepting excuses. You will enter that top 5 percent and become stronger as a person.Why? First and foremost, you will stop making excusesto yourself.Beyond the Excuse 27 === Page 56 === E1C02 11/14/2009 10:9:23 Page 28 It is far easier to make excuses to ourselves than we realize. Do you know the number one excuse people give for not going to the gym to exercise? The gym is too crowded. Stop and think about that one for a minute. ‘‘Gee, I know I ought to go to the gym, but it’s awfully crowded at this time of day.’’ McDonald’s gets crowded, too, but we don’t seem to have a problem with waiting in that line! We give ourselves too many excuses, and the result is that we get weaker—physically, e motionally, spiritually— each and every time we buy into our own excuse orsomeone else’s. EXCUSES PUT THE FOCUS ON THE STORY Again, excuses are stories we make up about why we believe we are not responsible, when we know we actually are. Every time we make or accept an excuse, we put our energy and attention into The Story, we lose transparencyin the relationship, and our values slip. Eventually, if we’renot careful, The Story—not our own guiding values and notour strategic priorities—becomes the way we make it through the day. We seem to think that if The Story is good enough, there’s not really any problem. Guess what? No matter how good The Story is, we still haven’t ﬁxed the problem! We as a society are spending way too much time on The Story and way too little time on doing what we ought to bedoing with",

Let me ask you a question: Have youever come up with a creative story for coming in late to work? Even once? Making excuses puts all the energy and focus on The Story and no focus, with no energy, on the situation athand. The Story never makes you a better team player, a better leader, or a better contributor. The Story underminesyour abilities and ultimately, your self-esteem. So, for instance: If you’re in sales, when you don’t make the sale, stop coming up with a new, intricate story blamingthe client. You know the kind of story I mean: ‘‘They misled me every step of the way . . . they never really gave me a shot . . . they deliberately wasted mytime . . . they couldn’t make up their mind . . . they hadthis sweetheart deal with the competition that they didn’ttell me about . . . ’’ You will never be a better salesperson if you don’t take responsibility for the end result. Either they bought it, orthey didn’t. Period. You’re not getting paid to write TheStory about why they didn’t buy. No one gets hired to comeback with excuses—or a trunk load full of product. When we choose to focus on The Story, we get so caught up in arguing for our limitations that we actuallyaccept them as reality. We focus on The Story and not thesolution, so we never ﬁx the problems that are actuallyholding us back . It is only when we face the facts and eliminate the excuses that we discover the answers to our questions,the solutions to our challenges, and the behaviors that willultimately deliver the kind of business and life that we wantand deserve.Beyond the Excuse 29 === Page 58 === E1C02 11/14/2009 10:9:23 Page 30 Eventually, we have to stop and ask ourselves: What is our story—our excuse—going to cost us?

I may even start wondering whether the vaca- tion money I spent to come torture myself in this marathon would have been better spent on a chaise lounge and a coldbeer overlooking a beautiful beach in Cozumel. Therecomes a point as I’m running a marathon when I beginto hear ‘‘quit.’’ And it’s at that point that I have to decidewhether I’m going to listen to all the reasons for quitting that my mind can come up with. It’s at that point that I have to decide whether I’m going to buy into my own stories. It’s a question of whether you’re looking for reasons to sell yourself an excuse or reasonsnot to. That’s what happened to me in my ﬁrst Boston Marathon. By mile ﬁve of the race, I had killer cramps, and at one point,I was bent over and in pain by the side of the road. I couldhave bailed out; there were plenty of reasons I could havegiven myself—plenty of stories I could have told myself—to support the idea of quitting. I pulled myself together and kept running. I saw myself crossing the ﬁnish line. At mile 7.7, when you leave Framingham, Hanson Elec- tric is on the right side of the road. Hanson Electric is asingle-story building with reﬂective plate glass windows. Old Man Hanson stands in front of the store, and using a bullhorn, yells, ‘‘Check yourself out in the window; checkout your form as you run by!’’ If you see your form in the window and you look good, it could be a comfortable 19 miles to the ﬁnish line.

It was worse than I thought.Now, Old Man Hanson must have seen me and taken pity, because the next thing I heard was, ‘‘Don’t worry. Objectsin window may look worse than they really are.’’ So, now I had evidence for another story if I wanted it. Who am I kidding? I not only feel awful, I look awful.Maybe I didn’t train correctly.

Wellesley is one of the nation’s great all- women’s schools, and there’s a tradition of supporting the Marathon. Suddenly, there are thousands of women liningthe street to cheer you on. As I ran by, I looked around andthought: You know what? This would be a great place to pause . . . for a semester or two! Another possible story ﬂashes through my mind: Hey, I made it all the way to Wellesley. That’s a pretty good effort. Maybe that’s goodenough. I was tempted, but I put that story aside and kept running. I saw myself crossing the ﬁnish line. At mile 15, there was a table with cups of water for the runners, and I knew I needed water really badly, but thetable was so crowded that I decided not to stop. Before Ipassed the table, though, I felt a spray of water on my back.Someone must have seen that I needed the water and justthrown it out at me. I looked back in gratitude. It was a Catholic priest. I think he was giving me the last rites! I kept running. I saw myself crossing the ﬁnish line. When we eliminate the excuses, we don’t even deal with them.

I am proud to be able to tell you that I crossed the ﬁnish line that day. And the reason was actually pretty simple: I didn’t give any energy to the stories that were looking for a place to land in my head. There always comes a point where we have a choice. We can focus on the excuse, The Story—all the reasons why things shouldn’t happen—or we can focus on the ﬁnish line.When we choose to focus on the excuses, we take our-selves out of the game.

We’re throwing a pity party. Excuses are a plea for sympathy when thingsaren’t going precisely our way.

We must pose this question for ourselves as individ- uals and for any people who are looking to us as a leader. Sometimes people say to me, ‘‘Sam, it sounds inspiring, but how do I start? What do I actually do? What happens ifI don’t know what my own ‘right things’ are? What if myteam doesn’t know?’’ One good way to start when it comes to doing the right things is to benchmark others and ﬁnd out what their right things are. Looking at what others are doing to get results that are similar to the ones you want toget in your own life can be a great reality check. Call peopleup and take them out to lunch (like I did). Ask them, ‘‘Whatare you doing?’’ Writing this book has been a truly great experience for me in terms of implementing and reinforcing this criticalExecution and Results Without exception, anyone in a leadership role has tostand tall and accept the responsibility not only forsetting the vision but also for establishing the strategy,for the execution, and the results. —Nido QubeinThe First Accountability: Doing the Right Things 39 === Page 68 === E1C03 11/14/2009 10:15:18 Page 40 ﬁrst level of",

Those interviews have allowed me to get multiple reality checks on the right things that these people aredoing in their everyday lives, day in and day out. In fact, I’velearned more about doing the right things in the last sixmonths than I learned in the previous six years. But I had to take the initiative. I had to reach out to people and askif they’d share what they’d learned about accountability in their own lives and then askthem for speciﬁc examples of right things that worked for them insupporting their accountability to a big goal. Contrary towhat you might think, I found that the more successful people were, the more willing they were to share their ‘‘do the right thing’’ stories with me. Getting in touch withpeople in the ﬁrst place sometimes takes a little persist-ence; and no, wrestling your way onto their calendar isn’talways easy. But once you connect and once you get people talking, you get ideas and insights on what the right things look like, how to reﬁne them, and how to execute them inyour world at a level of excellence.

You are the one who has to be accountable for managing that process. There was a time when I was with the Patriots when I was getting beaten by a defensive lineman by the name of Joe Klecko—a great player and a great guy.Joe was controlling what was happening and making me look bad. On the sidelines, I got frustrated. I knew I was trying too hard, and my frustration was growing.My coach sat me on the bench and told me to calmdown. He said something I’ll never forget: ‘‘Sit here andthink about what he’s doing to beat you and what you need to do to stop him. He’s not better than you. You’re just using the wrong technique. In any given game, you have to have a toolbox full of techniques.

And no, you don’t have to be a salesperson to get it! Some sales managers (in fact, most sales managers) fall into an unfortunate trap. They get hooked on counting which‘‘closed deals’’ have come in the door over the last week;they get addicted to comparing that number to the teamquota, the number their department is supposed to hit. That’s as far as they look: ‘‘What’s come in recently, and how does it match up with the quota for this month?’’ (Or, even worse:‘‘How does it match up with the quota for this quarter?’’) Some sales managers take a more tactically sound ap- proach; they ask, ‘‘What activities have been proven to lead to sales, and what’s the daily quota for those activities?’’ Once the sales manager knows the answer to that ques-tion—once he or she has concluded for certain that Xnumber of conference calls with decision makers at theCFO level or above leads to Y number of new customersover Z period of time—that sales manager doesn’t get distracted by the number of deals coming in the door today.

Some sales managers call these right things Key Per- formance Indicators. That name works for me as well asany other.

In other words: If you sell for a living, don’t get distracted by the sales that come in the door today! Not closing a deal today isn’t all that big of a deal if you’ve been doing the right things to support your selling goal for the past month; closing that deal today may actually take your eye off the ball.

It’s something we all have tohold ourselves accountable for. If you let yourself getdragged into the minutiae— if you are constantly being a micromanager— the micromanaging rolls downhill.

Our experience is,when you get more than two or three initiatives in agiven year, or four at the most, there’s just no wayyou’re going to accomplish them, because it’s im- possible to keep track of them. So, when we do our strategic planning, we make sure we walk out of thestrategic planning process with no more than two orthree major initiatives. And then, we create responsi-bility for those initiatives. Who’s going to do this? Is it a committee? Is it an individual? Is it the whole group? And we agree to what the action item is going to be foraccomplishing that particular initiative. —Peter SchickNo More Excuses 56 === Page 85 === E1C03 11/14/2009 10:15:19 Page 57",

And this, of course, is one of the bigchallenges managers face. Ultimately, within any organiza-tion, it is the manager’s responsibility to ensure that the rightthings that are in place are appropriate, not only to the organization’s strategic intent but also to the changing cir- cumstances that must inevitably be accommodated. For each of us, the right things may vary, given our individual skills and the nature of the changes our teamsencounter, but those will always have the goal in sight. For me, the right things might be to review my own strategic plan and measure progress, to reach out to newprospects, to deliver a certain number of speeches, to buildrelationships with key executives, or to write a new articlefor my monthly business ezine. That all supports thestrategic intent I have of growing my business to a certain level. For the people in my organization who I manage, I am accountable for synchronizing my company’s strategicintent with each team member’s skills, aptitudes, and interests. This means that each member of the teammay—and typically does—pursue a unique array of right things. If I were to pretend that all of my employees were identical and had the same skills, aptitudes, and interestsso that I could assign the same right things to each andevery team member, I would be letting everyone down. Iwould be overlooking my accountability to them to identify the right things that would allow them to make headway on our shared goals, so I couldn’t be too surprised if they didnot make headway.

The keyThe First Accountability: Doing the Right Things 57 === Page 86 === E1C03 11/14/2009 10:15:19 Page 58 is to develop a list of right things that plays to each team member’s strength. Giving ourselves the very best list of right things to do means knowing our own strong suits and adjusting accord-ingly, based on our strategic intent and our current circum-stances. I’ve found that people who are personallyaccountable to themselves, ﬁrst and foremost, have a way of mastering this skill of adjusting what they do.

We have asked them to be accountable for doing the best they can. If their best is an A, great. If their best is a B, then so be it. We havealso given them the authority to ﬁgure out how to do their best. If they slip below a B, then we step in. We delegate,but we don’t abdicate. It’s our responsibility to check in and ﬁnd out how our kids are doing. If you supervise people, it’s the same withyour team members. Delegate both the responsibility and the authority for your people to do the right things that support your organization—and then stay engaged enoughto track whether they’re actually delivering the results you and your team have agreed upon. Only when you delegate both the responsibility and the accountability does the person feel that he or she owns the goal. And only when the person has that feeling of owner-ship is there going to be accountability.

That’s what allows them to recognize their strengths and weaknesses. And thebetter leaders are transparent about this. You know,it’s not a comfortable thing to talk to your directreports or to other senior people and say, ‘‘Folks,here’s where I’m really strong, and here is where I’m weak.’’ Self-awareness can create clarity with your team on where your time will or will not bespent.

If you could do anything for that afternoon and you had the period from 1:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. absolutely open, what would you put in that slot? Once you know the answers to that question—whether they are ‘‘design a whole new product,’’ or ‘‘reachout to my best customers,’’ or ‘‘create a new marketresearch initiative,’’ or ‘‘build relationships with executives at other ﬁrms,’’—ask yourself how you can work the best of those new initiatives into your schedule tomorrow . What will you get rid of to make space for the most importantnew priorities you’ve identiﬁed? For instance: If you stopped handling all the phone prospecting yourself and delegated it to someone elsewho could do it just as well, what would you do withthat time that could produce even greater results for you? Ifyou’re not willing to ask those (sometimes uncomfortable)questions, you’re not managing your space effectively. You’re using force of habit as a strategic forecasting tool.

What newproducts would you be able to ﬁll your ﬂoor space with? The choice to expand your business by getting rid of a proﬁtable line and replacing it with something more rele-vant to your current goals may at ﬁrst seem counterintuitiveor even foolish. Yet, this is what great visionaries havealways done. It’s evidence of accountability and of your willingness to take seriously your responsibility to allocate your resources strategically. Sometimes, accepting this responsibility means making dramatic changes in our lives and in our businesses. That ismuch better than pretending that whatever you’re alreadydoing always makes perfect strategic sense.(continued ) What we found is that a lot of our customers were really more inclined to do things themselves than they were to ask for help. So, we were able to revise thebudget and put the resources to work elsewhere,which we would never have done if we hadn’t askedthe question in the ﬁrst place. —Pat Larmon Eliminating 35 Percent of the Business We chose more than a decade ago to eliminate anyproduct that had anything to do with commissionablebroker-dealer fees, because those products wereNo More Excuses 72 === Page 101 === E1C04 11/14/2009 10:19:14 Page 73 APPLE DROPS THE MINI A few years ago, Apple, the dominant player in the personal music player category, dropped its best-selling product, theiPod Mini. Why? Because they were launching a brand newproduct that took the iPod experience to another level: theiPod Nano. Most businesses would have been extremely hesitant to simply jettison a proﬁtable product, let alone a category leader, regardless of what they had on the drawingboard at the time. Apple was different. Why? The answer: Apple’s business philosophy was different. It was based on creating new space. The company’s stated operating principle was—and is—that they would rather make themselves obsolete than watch the competition do it! The iPod Mini represented where Apple had been. It was what everyone who was competing with Apple was tryingto match. Apple’s approach could have been to keep",

For a lot of companies, that strategy would have been seen as the safest. But Apple’s senior management saw complacency as the bigger com- petitive danger. Apple’s senior management knew something that many business strategists forget: People and organizations usuallycling to seemingly safe options for far too long out of sheer force of habit. When they do, they inevitably lose ground. We are told as we are brought up, ‘‘A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.’’ I never hear anyone ask, ‘‘What if there are three birds in the bush? Or ﬁve? Or ten? How oldis the bird in your hand, anyway? What if the bird that’s inyour hand is losing weight and isn’t looking as chipper as it once did?’’ Assuming that you’ve got the right bird means that you’re not managing your space. We are accountable for managing our own space to create new possibilities for growth in income, pleasure, and per-sonal development. We are accountable for moving beyond familiar patterns and ﬁnding new opportunities. ‘‘We’ve always done it that way’’ is, on its own, no excuse for notmanaging our space. Force of habit, though powerful, is noexcuse for not managing our space. Familiarity, thoughcomforting, is no excuse for not managing our space. We are accountable to ask what if. We are responsible to explore where we can create space that could be ﬁlled withsomething that could offer us a greater yield.

Lowe’s went from offering 135,000 products to offering93,000 products in their hardware stores. Sometimes,a simpler business is a more proﬁtable business. So,what did they eliminate? Maybe they don’t have 19 different types of lawn mowers on display anymore. Maybe people don’t want to have every type of lawnmower to choose from. It almost becomes too much;people are overloaded, and they can’t deal with allthe technical speciﬁcations they have to analyze inorder to make a good choice. Maybe Lowe’s listened to the consumer who said, ‘‘Look, all I want is a lawn mower to mow the grass. I don’t need to have fourdifferent kinds of hedgers to choose from, each withtwelve different attachments.’’ —Michael StaenbergThe Second Accountability: Managing Your Space 75 === Page 104 === E1C04 11/14/2009 10:19:14 Page 76 Aluminum Industries. The company’s main product was aluminum storm windows. The ﬁrm did very well. Indeed, my father-in-law pretty much lived the American dream during the company’s earlyyears. It grew so fast, in fact, that my father-in-law decidedhe needed some help. By the time my brother-in-law and I decided to buy into the company in the early 1980s, Delsan was enjoying somepretty remarkable success in the marketplace. In fact, wewere a major provider of aluminum storm windows in theMidwest. Then something astonishing happened: We found a whole new market. Shortly before I joined Delsan, my father-in-law had introduced a new product line: vinyl replacement windows.I vowed to push the volume on the new window products,and push it I did. The sales exceeded everyone’s expect-ations and just kept growing. The new offering transformed our business. We were accumulating huge numbers of new accounts—accountsthat were worth more, far",

Irealized that we were capable of doing things in the marketplace with vinyl products that we’d never been able to do before with the aluminum ones. We startedlooking for new vinyl products to pull into the mix, andthe response got even better. This presented us with an interesting situation. The aluminum storm window had established us as a companyand was an ‘‘emotional favorite’’ for us. We thought ofit as the heart of the company. It was making money. But itwas not our core product anymore, and its volume wasdropping.No More Excuses 76 === Page 105 === E1C04 11/14/2009 10:19:14 Page 77 We realized that we had to take a long, hard look at the direction of our business. We did an analysis and concluded that we were not turning our inventory fast enough on the aluminum prod- ucts to justify continuing their presence in our line. Thathurt, but it was true. Another problem was that the ﬂoorspace required to manufacture the aluminum windows was massive; we could use the same space to create vinyl products and generate at least four or ﬁve timesthe product volume (and by extension, four or ﬁve timesthe proﬁt) from the same space. What was more, we hada lot of new vinyl product lines that we wanted to addand currently couldn’t. We changed our name to Delsan Industries, and we sold off our signature product—the genesis of the entire orga-nization, the aluminum storm window. This product hadmade the company millions of dollars in years past and wasstill proﬁtable. But it was the wrong investment for us as an organization. We needed new space. Selling off the old line was a hard decision, but it was a very sound move strategically, because it allowed us tofocus on the products that would take our company to the next level. If we had decided simply to continue making aluminum storm windows because that was what we werefamiliar with doing and good at doing, we would havefollowed a very different path in the years ahead. I liked the path we chose. It led us to exponential growth and a level of commercial success that we could hardlyhave imagined before we took on the vinyl line.

With this move, we conﬁrmed something essential about our organization and the way we were going to take it where it had to go next. We made it clear to everyone in the organization that what we were familiar with or successfulat doing in the past was always open for review. Of course,not every company feels that way about its core businesslines. But that wasn’t all. With this decision, we also made it clear that the company leadership was responsible for launching new ideas and new initiatives. That was true,even if it meant leaving behind something that made a lotof emotional sense or something that was still workingfor us. We conﬁrmed, as a working principle, that creating new opportunities, creating new space, was part of ourjob description as company leaders and part of what weexpected from others in the organization. We had to createspace to try new things and grow. That was now part ofour culture. By the way, we sold the aluminum storm window busi- ness to the plant manager who had been operating it foryears.

The ﬁlm industry know-it-alls dismissed the project as ‘‘Disney’s Folly,’’ and Disney’sown wife advised him that no one would pay a dime to see this picture. Walt thought otherwise and went about reinventing his own studio. Every available resource was channeled toward the new project. He knew full well that the technology did not exist to make the animated movie he had in mind. He wanted the depth of ﬁeld and the three-dimensional feeling of a well- made live-action ﬁlm. Instead of relying on the same toolsthat had made him a household name with his MickeyMouse and Three Little Pigs shorts, he resolved to createthe new tools he and his team would need. He made new space for himself. That new space was called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The technical advances necessary to bring Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs out of Disney’s head and onto the screen had to be built from scratch.

Whenever you do run into adversity (and you will), your response to it will conﬁrm for yourself, and everyone else,(continued ) identify different courses of action, as long as they are legitimate and fair and honest, and then start to manage those processes. One of the things that weare looking at in our own organization is that it is verydifﬁcult to predict with any great degree of accuracyhow our business is going to perform from quarter to quarter. Now, on one hand, we could say, ‘‘Okay, well, we can’t control it.’’ That would take us out ofaccountability. What I constantly preach instead to my direct reports is how important it is for us to do two things. First, wehave to be willing to step up as soon as we anticipate that we are going to have a problem, and we have to be open and transparent about that, because bad newsdoes not get better with age. And then second, we haveto identify the things we can do to mitigate the problem.If we think we are going to fall short of our revenue projections, is there anything we can do from a cost standpoint to improve the situation? If we just waituntil the end of the quarter, it will be too late to goback and make any of those adjustments. —Richard ChambersNo More Excuses 88 === Page 117 === E1C05 11/14/2009 10:23:26 Page 89 exactly what kind of person you are: someone who is personally accountable for managing the process or some- one who isn’t.

Just up from the city center is awonderful area called Canyon Road; it’s about a mile long,and it’s lined with artists’ galleries on both sides. Renee andI walked in and out of the various galleries as we strolledGood Leaders, Poor Leaders Every day we are faced with situations that are un-expected and are not within our control. One of the other things that distinguishes a good leader from a poor one is the ability to understand how to cope withand adjust to such situations. —Sir Andrew LikiermanThe Third Accountability: Managing the Process 89 === Page 118 === E1C05 11/14/2009 10:23:26 Page 90 down the street. We had no intention of buying a paint- ing. In fact, I didn’t particularly want to buy anything that afternoon. Renee and I came across one gallery featuring Phyllis Kapp, a prominent local artist. After we walked through all of the rooms, admiring the magniﬁcent paintings, we saw awell-dressed lady approaching us. It turned out that Phyllis herself was in the gallery that day. She started a conversation; we began chatting pleas- antly with her. Eventually, Phyllis asked, ‘‘Which painting is your favorite?’’ The moment those words were out of her mouth, I remember thinking to myself, She’s managing the process! After all, we had no intention of buying a painting oranything else. Phyllis had the strategic intent of selling apainting, and we’d given her no indication whatsoever thatwe wanted to buy anything. She was in a situation whereher strategic intent faced an obstacle (our silence). By asking that question, she was taking action toward her goal, anyway. We still had no intention to buy a painting, but more out of a sense of courtesy than anything else, we took Phyllisback into one of the rooms and pointed out a particular piece that was hanging in the middle of the wall. It was a watercolor with bright, vibrant colors: a desert land-scape with mountains and a beautiful sky. ‘‘That’s ourfavorite,’’ my wife said. (She was right, of course; beforePhyllis had shown up, we’d each mentioned that we’d liked that painting.) Phyllis proceeded to tell us all about that particular piece. She told us how she had come to paint it, what she",

Then, she asked usNo More Excuses 90 === Page 119 === E1C05 11/14/2009 10:23:26 Page 91 another great question: ‘‘Where in your house do you imagine this hanging?’’ Phyllis was still managing the process. Think about what has to happen in order for that piece of art to hang in ourhouse. Of course: We would have to buy it. She was asking us a question whose very answer required us to buy thepicture—in our minds. And getting us to buy the painting was, of course, Phyllis’s strategic intent. We hadn’t walked in the door looking for a painting to buy, but when Phyllis asked that question, we actuallystarted thinking about where it might look best in ourhome. I smiled and answered, ‘‘In our family room.’’ And that’s where the painting is hanging today. Was this some kind of magic trick? Did her question always get people to start thinking about where they’d hang her work? Of course not. Nothing sells paintings—orproduces any other positive outcome—100 percent of the time. I’m conﬁdent, however, that Phyllis does sell a lot more paintings than a person who never manages theprocess.

Many people, as you’ve probably noticed, are very good at abdicating andspend most of their time and energy explaining why they can’t move forward on a goal.

Even though everyone was panicking, and some people even said that we hadto close all operations, I looked at it as an opportunityto upgrade our services and upgrade our capabilities.On very short notice, we were able to recruit one of the top surgeons in the country. So, we deﬁantly adjusted ourselves to a situation that we were notable to control. What we could control was our re-cruitment effort. We enlisted the help of the entireadministration, from the dean down to the chair ofsurgery, and the result was that we found one of the best surgeons in the country. —Achi LudomirskyNo More Excuses 92 === Page 121 === E1C05 11/14/2009 10:23:26 Page 93 this world, but we can control the choices we make in response to whatever does happen. Phyllis didn’t let fate or luck determine her outcome. She took action and managed the process. In stark contrast, most of the galleries that we went into did not manage the process. Instead, they abdicated! Here’s what abdicating looks like: Some of the galleries we looked at that day simply let people walk in and walkout, without ever engaging them in conversation. Most ofthe galleries we visited were overseen by someone whowasn’t very good at establishing rapport. Typically, thatperson walked up to us and asked what you and I havebeen asked hundreds of times before in hundreds of stores: ‘‘May I help you?’’ That person wasn’t managing the process. He or she was reciting a question that could,and did, routinely receive responses that pushed theconversation further away from the strategic intent of selling a painting. When I said what so many of us would say—‘‘No thanks, I’m just looking’’—the person said, ‘‘Okay, let me know ifyou need any help,’’ and the conversation ended. You couldtell that some of these people really didn’t want to be havingthe conversation at all. In fact, I think they were terriﬁed of having the conversation in the ﬁrst place! They were notwilling to be accountable for managing the process. That’s ashame, because the lower your accountability for manag- ing the process, the less effective you will be at negotiatingoutcomes that support your strategic intent.

It’s the person who isn’t terriﬁed of improvising. People who are used to improvising when they encoun- ter an obstacle to their strategic intent have learned tothink on their own feet. They’re comfortable doing so, justlike Phyllis was. They’ve learned to keep moving forward toward the goal —even though there’s no instruction book around to tell them exactly what has to happen next. Phyllis got an A in my book, because she created her own Accountability Zone. She knew that she and she alone was accountable for managing the process. Someone across thestreet who says ‘‘May I help you?’’ and ‘‘Let me know if youneed anything’’ gets an F! If you are not accountable to manage the process, you have left the Accountability Zone. You are ceding account-ability for some aspect of your life to forces outside of yourcontrol. EXAMINE NEAR MISSES! Managing the process, as we’ve seen, is what we do whenwe encounter an obstacle, and we still ﬁnd some way to make headway on our strategic intent. One big asset in managing the process is close analysis of the phenomenonknown as a near miss. An e a rm i s si nt h ew o r l do fa i rt r a f - ﬁc control is what happens when a pilot almost encounters a major obstacle—namely, another aircraft. That encoun- ter could have derailed the pilot’s strategic intent of com- pleting the journey safely, but thanks to quick thinking onthe pilot’s part, the mission is not compromised. The near miss idea applies not only to processes that affect human safety but to every undertaking with theNo More Excuses 94 === Page 123 === E1C05 11/14/2009 10:23:26 Page 95 potential to affect our strategic intent. That means we want to know about the sales that were nearly lost, the defective units that were nearly shipped, the P.R. disaster that nearly played out. These are important events. The government mandates that airlines maintain full accountability for reporting,categorizing, and analyzing their near misses, so they’ll be more effective at managing the process when similar circumstances arise in the future. We must hold ourselvesaccountable for the same kind of close analysis. Justthanking our lucky stars",

This is one of the areas that Highly Accountable People are endlessly committed to. They never stop asking these great questions: ‘‘What do our near misses teach us? Whathave we learned? How can we keep this problem from arising again?’’ Don’t ask me why this kind of event is called a near miss rather than a near hit; that’s one of those inscrutable mysteries of life. The point is, a responsible review ofany project must include an above-board discussion and analysis of allthe near misses that we’ve experienced. We can’t wait for a plane to crash before we conduct a review of whether our airline’s safety procedures are appropriate!We have to look closely at the accidents that almost happened, the collisions that were narrowly averted, and the people who were nearly hurt and adjust accordingly. If we are truly accountable, we will recognize these events for the blessings in disguise that they are. Near misses tell us where there are likely to be challenges thatkeep us from realizing our strategic intent.The Third Accountability: Managing the Process 95 === Page 124 === E1C05 11/14/2009 10:23:26 Page 96 Warning: Leaders within any process-focused organiza- tion must go out of their way to praise and reward individuals who report near misses. If your company cul- ture rewards the opposite behavior—concealing nearmisses—or punishes people who try to call attention tonear misses, you will not have the information you need to improve your organization over time. It is impossible to create a truly accountable organization without reward-ing the people who help you learn from near misses andmanage the process based on what you’ve learned.

A while ago, when Wall Street sort of collapsed, virtually every hospital found itself facing majorshortfalls in terms of its investment income—whichis a major source of capital for hospitals. Overnight,most hospitals were looking at portfolios that had dropped by 30 percent or more. And so, the question is, how do you respond to that? About 90 percent ofour competitors responded by simply freezing capi-tal projects, discontinuing beneﬁts, cutting tuition,and so on. Instead of doing that, we said, ‘‘Wait aminute—most hospitals are not-for-proﬁt organiza- tions; they don’t live quarter by quarter. Our mission is not to deliver a dividend to investors.’’ We decided to send the message, internally and externally, that it was important for people’s carethat we keep building private beds, keep investing in cutting-edge technology, keep managing infection control. So, for me, managing the process meantaccepting that yes, we will have some cash depletionin the short term and we will have to be smart, but ourinvestment income will come back. In the meantime, we are going to stick to our priorities. Why was something we thought was very important a yearago suddenly not important?

The sales manager asked the salesperson whathad happened during the meeting, and the salespersonanswered, ‘‘Well, it turns out they’re not buying.’’ The sales manager asked, ‘‘Why not?’’ And the salesperson replied, ‘‘Let’s face it: We’re in a tough economy. That’s the reality we’re up against now.’’ Wrong answer. The sales manager hit the roof. He said, ‘‘The economy is why you didn’t close the sale? Don’t tell me that. Tell me you didn’t close the sale because ofsomething you could have done differently, or Icould have done differently, or the company could have done differently, so we can ﬁgure out how to do it better the next time.

I think we’re all tempted at times to abdicate in just the way that salesperson did—to step away from managing the process and buy into excuses. Every time we make an excuse and every time we abdicate, we stop managing theprocess.

The mission was to be the third manned landing on the moon, and it was launched at a point when amoon landing was seen by some members of the public asroutine. Routine means that there’s no adversity, no obsta- cle, no problem to overcome. You’re following the plan, and it’s working. There are no bumps in the road. No space mission is actually routine, of course. There are countless adversities and challenges to deal with as any such mission moves forward. Everyone at NASA knew thatmuch. But the world at large ﬁgured out for sure that the Apollo 13 mission really wasn’t routine when word came that one of the ship’s oxygen tanks had blown up, causing another tank to fail, crippling the command module, andforcing the crew to move into the lunar module, whichbecame their lifeboat. Suddenly, the moon no longer mattered. There was a new strategic intent: getting the crew home safely, despitethe many obstacles that appeared to stand in the way ofthat goal. A new course had to be plotted for earth. Withnavigational systems down, the astronauts would have to manually reorient the ship for a safe trajectory back to earth, using the sun as a navigational point. The lunarmodule, where the men were now camping out, was closeto freezing. There was limited oxygen and even lesswater—barely enough water to sustain life and cool theThe Third Accountability: Managing the Process 101 === Page 130 === E1C05 11/14/2009 10:23:26 Page 102 ship during ﬁnal phases of the trip home. The oxygen ﬁlters in the lunar module had been designed for two men, not three. This meant that with every breath, the astro- nauts were taxing the system and coming closer to poi-soning themselves with carbon monoxide. The astronautswould have to create new ﬁlters from scratch to ﬁt thelunar module’s system. Last but not least, the power situation was critical: If the crew did not ﬁnd some way to use its available power more efﬁciently, theywould die before they reached earth. None of these problems had clear solutions at the time they arose. All of",

Procedures for the new mission had to be created from scratch—and tested on the ground in Houston—more or less instantly. There were no protocols for han-dling the new and daunting series of obstacles that hadarisen. Working together, the astronauts and Houston had to assume mutual accountability for managing the pro- cess and for moving forward toward the goal, despite a lack of experience in resolving the obstacles that had presented themselves. I’ll be sharing more thoughts onthe important subject of mutual accountability in the next chapter, ‘‘The Fourth Accountability: Establishing the Right Expectations.’’ If people had tried to follow an existing script, if they had used the old job descriptions, or if they had wasted timeﬁguring out whose fault it was that the tanks had exploded, the new strategic intent of saving the men from disaster would have been compromised, and the astronauts wouldalmost certainly not have made it home. As it happened, theteam as a whole, in space and on the ground, was able towork together to manage the process.No More Excuses 102 === Page 131 === E1C05 11/14/2009 10:23:26 Page 103 When the lives of the Apollo 13 astronauts were in grave and immediate danger, NASA didn’t throw up its collec- tive hands and say, ‘‘Well, I guess a successful outcome to this mission just wasn’t meant to be.’’ Why are so manypeople ready to relinquish their accountability for manag-ing the process when they hit obstacles that are far lessdaunting? To provide that kind of leadership, we must model the skill of thinking and acting creatively. Following the most familiar set of instructions wouldn’t have gotten the Apollo 13 astronauts home safely, and it won’t get your team pastthe many unpredictable challenges they will encounter.Failure Is Not an Option Gene Kranz, the mission control director for Apollo13, had a saying: ‘‘Failure is not an option.’’ As busi- nesses are beset with setbacks and failures, likewise, individuals suffer setbacks and failures—but in spiteof those risks, we should set lofty goals. We shouldhave an expectation that We—and that is with acapital ‘‘W’’—can solve the most intractable or seem- ingly impossible situations. That mindset has to be- come part of the culture. There’s a sense of undyingoptimism that I think is a characteristic of many greatleaders; a sense that somehow, we will ﬁgure this out.Apollo 13 is my favorite example",

Once we accept them, they determine our actions, our outlook, and our destinies. They create our world. Expectations areworth setting consciously. But we often set them heed-lessly, both for ourselves and for others. Make the Goal Obtainable Sometimes, the goals are set too high.

We are accountable for establishing not just any expectation but the right expectation, both for ourselves as individuals and for the team we oversee. The fourth accountability is all about ﬁguring out what the potential is in a given situation and then adjusting ourexpectations accordingly, in alignment with our strategicintent. The quality of our expectations inevitably deter- mines the quality of our measurable results, both individu- ally and organizationally. We are accountable for what we decide to expect from ourselves, how we decide to strive for it ,and whether we actually measure the outcomes of our efforts to fulﬁll those expectations . Managing our expectations on an ongoing basis is essential. Our quality of life depends in large degree on our ability to manage expectations. When we allow ourselves simply to base our expectations on past results, we are not effectively managing our(continued ) it. The other challenge comes when the bar is set so low that you trip over it. I think one of the worst things you can do to someone is refuse to stretch them. All ofus need to come up against a little resistance in life.So, there’s an art to setting our own expectations, andby the same token, there’s an art to setting expect- ations for other people.

The following story will make the distinction clear. THE $5,000 MAN Back in 1960, Maxwell Maltz wrote a remarkable book called Psycho-Cybernetics. It’s a book about our account- ability to manage our own expectations. Cybernetics is a real-life science, the science of goal- driven systems—guided missiles, for instance, that can hit a moving target in midair, or a piece of computer software that identiﬁes the shortest route from point A to point B. These are systems that are designed to attain a certaingoal. Maltz’s book proposes that the human brain andnervous system are themselves cybernetic systems. Heargues that human beings live goal-focused lives. TheGet the Expectations Right I don’t think it is possible to overstate how important it is to get the expectations set properly in the begin- ning, regardless of what it is you are talking about. Ifyou can’t set reasonable expectations for yourself andothers, everything else is for naught. —George TamkeThe Fourth Accountability: Establishing the Right Expectations 109 === Page 138 === E1C06 11/14/2009 10:24:58 Page 110 problem is, they don’t always realize what goals they’ve set for themselves and sometimes don’t even choose those goals consciously. One example Maltz gives is of a salesperson working in the 1950s who managed to make $5,000 in a single year from a subpar sales territory. Even back then, $5,000 a yearwasn’t a huge amount of money, but it was a high enough ﬁgure to make this salesperson’s manager wonder what would happen if the same man had a prime territory towork in. Full of optimism, he gave the fellow a much betterterritory but saw his overall sales effectiveness drop almostinstantly. When the next year was ﬁnished, he had earnedonly $5,000, despite having access to much greater oppor- tunity in the new territory. So it continued, year after year. No matter how promis- ing, or dismal, the salesperson’s territory was, he always found a way to make it produce roughly $5,000 for him in commissions. One year, he was signiﬁcantly ahead of quota with plenty of time still to sell, and his sales manager thought that the pattern was ﬁnally broken. No suchluck. The salesperson developed a mysterious illness,spent several months out of the ﬁeld, and returned toaction just in time to ﬁnish the year at",

He saw himself as a $5,000-a-year man. What he didn’t do was manage his expectations effec- tively. If he’d wanted to, he could have seen himself as a $30,000-a-year man, quite a sum for the mid-1950s, or an even higher ﬁgure. His past did not have to determine his future. But he allowed it to by default, because he refused to change his own expectations on a fundamentallevel.No More Excuses 110 === Page 139 === E1C06 11/14/2009 10:24:58 Page 111 Another way of looking at this, of course, is that the salesperson never had a manager who helped him to set a new, more realistic expectation of himself. Sometimes, we sabotage ourselves by settling for ‘‘what we’ve always done.’’ That salesperson’s return to the hom- ing signal of $5,000 in annual income was not a unique case,and the phenomenon of not managing one’s expectations effectively is certainly not limited to the world of sales. It is, however, fairly easy to measure in the world of sales, and the same story has played out countless times on countlesssales teams. I suspect that most sales managers today could provide multiple examples of people on their teams who had very similar experiences. This reﬂects lost opportunity for both the organization and the salesperson. These situa- tions change for the better only when the individuals involved work with someone who can help them to acceptexplicit accountability for establishing ,n o ts i m p l yr e - peating, their own expectations. Changing an existingpattern often takes good coaching. And for most sales-people, simply raising the quota to some arbitrary numberis not good coaching. In the end, a coach can only help us to pose good questions. We are accountable for consciously establishingour own expectations to match the current situation, ourcurrent capacities, and our own strategic intent. Who’s Setting the Best Expectations?

You have to ask your team, ‘‘What can happen? What is possible? What is within reach? How much of that can weexpect to achieve?’’ That’s the discussion you wantto have. That’s what you build your constituency on—not the other way around: ‘‘What did we do last year?X?

We were in deep trouble. We were hemor- rhaging money, and it wasn’t pretty. One huge problem we faced was our turnaround time. Our customers really didn’t like the six or eight weeks ittook to get our products. I knew that one of our competi-tors had a guaranteed two-week turnaround and that this competitor was turning around most of its orders in a single week. This competitor was hammering our company! We began to look for ways to measurably reduce the amount of time it took us to process, assemble, and ship outan order. Because our competition was having such suc- cess with the two-week guarantee, some of the senior executives wanted to simply issue an ultimatum to thepeople on the shop ﬂoor: Change the turnaround time from six weeks to two weeks maximum . . . or else! If we’d said that, however, we in management would have been making a big mistake. We would have beensimply holding people accountable for an expectation thatwe had in ourheads: two weeks, maximum! That would have been like telling the $5,000 salesperson that his quota was now $20,000! A grand gesture, but how effective would it have been?

We chose to focus on developing shared expect- ations that were based on the situation we currently faced, our own true capacities, and our strategic intent, whichwas to create a better offering than our competitor .The Fourth Accountability: Establishing the Right Expectations 113 === Page 142 === E1C06 11/14/2009 10:24:58 Page 114 I sat down with a diverse cross-section of the company— the senior management, the salespeople, the production supervisors, and the director of operations—and we had a team meeting. We looked closely at what was actuallytaking place when an order came in the door and whatwas actually happening on the production ﬂoor. Remember, I had done a little research to benchmark what other companies were doing, and I knew that com-petitor of ours was turning around many of its orders in one week, not two. I kept that part of the story to myself fornow. The critical point was that I knew it was possible to get the windows shipped in a single week. I now had to getthe key people in my company to buy into that expectation on their own. Instead of simply issuing orders to the production team or holding them accountable for a goal that they had no role in shaping, I asked them some questions: ‘‘What are all thesteps in the process of making a window, and how long does each of those steps take?’’ The director of operations broke everything down for us, from order entry to assemblyto packaging and shipping. And what he came up withwhen you added it all up was four and a half days. What did that mean? Two things. First, it meant that our production system was so inefﬁcient that it was taking four and a half days’ worth of work and stretching it out over a muchlonger period of time. And second, those inefﬁciencies hadcreated a huge backlog of orders that was keeping peoplefrom getting to new orders in a timely manner. During a break in the meeting, one of the senior manag- ers said to me privately, ‘‘Well, if they’ve got a four-and-a-half-day job, a two-week turnaround is eminently doable.Let’s make that the goal.’’No More Excuses 114 === Page 143 === E1C06 11/14/2009 10:24:58 Page 115 Again, this would have been like simply assigning a new quota to the $5,000 salesperson.

When we returned to the meeting, I asked the director of operations, ‘‘If we had a two-week timeline to hit, that would mean an order would just be sitting here for a whole week before anything started, right?’’ He thought for a moment and said, ‘‘Yes, that’s right. It doesn’t have to be that way. We really should be able to turn an order around in a week.’’ I said, ‘‘Great.

But it was based not on our current standard of performance but on the newassumption that it was possible to process, complete,and ship an order within a single business week.

According to many of the people I interviewed, the expectations we set for ourselves should, as a generalwe surround ourselves with or the social contextwithin which we make predictions about what we are likely to do. As a researcher, I’ve found that when I ask people to make predictions about behaviors likevoting, or choosing healthy foods, or being on time, orgetting their health checked, or taking their medica-tions, I ﬁnd that the act of asking them to predict what’s going to happen in their own lives is actually more effective in reinforcing those kinds of behaviorsthan simply reminding people about the behavior.

To ﬁnd out what’s possible today, we must be willing to look outside our comfort zone, our business, and our industry.Evaluate Your Expectations of Others If people keep missing their expectations, they getdiscouraged and despondent, and it gets worse as theygo along. So, you try to budget your expectations. Ifmy magazine’s salespeople keep missing the goalsthat I set for them, then obviously, I am doing a bad job. They will get discouraged, and sometimes they will go and do something else, which is not whatI’m after. So, it is a delicate balance. —Peter Legge Benchmark Based on What’s Happening outside Your World At our hospital, we constantly try to isolate whateverisn’t adding value to the customer and then minimize or eliminate the problem.

When you spend four hoursNo More Excuses 118 === Page 147 === E1C06 11/14/2009 10:24:58 Page 119 in a hospital, the only thing you really want to pay for is that 10 minutes you spend with the doctor when he tells you, ‘‘Here’s your medication, and here’s your treatment plan.’’ Then, you want to go home. So,everything that makes you wait would ideally needto be considered ‘‘non-value-added’’ and eliminated.That’s what we’re always moving toward. We always want to identify a baseline and a metric for what the customer actually wants to experience and then lookat whether we were successful in moving that needlein the right direction. In doing that, it’s been our experience that when we’re deciding what should be improved and by how much, we often want to benchmark based on what’s happening outside the hospital. We want to identify where the relevant best practice really is, and we wantto know what our own expectation should be inexecuting that best practice.

They must alsoStretch Your Expectations Every day, you have the opportunity to do things thatyou never thought you could accomplish—but thatmeans getting out of your comfort zone and experi-encing all the discomfort in learning, growing, failing,and striving in order to reach new levels. It may also mean trying to ratchet up the expectations someone has set for you instead of dumbing them down. —Jim McCoolyou want [to] get to on the income side, then it is notyour fault.

Get Full Value from Your Expectations If you set expectations too high, you are not going toget the full value out of your people. If you set expect-ations too low, you’re not getting the full value, either. You have to create a certain amount of tension interms of your expectations, but not too much. I think that a big challenge that a lot of business leaders have is that we set our expectations for others based onwhat we expect of ourselves. It is unreasonable forleaders to expect exactly the same things of othersthat they expect of themselves. Even in my ownbusiness, I used to get frustrated that people were not living up to the standards that I had set. I even- tually realized that the standards were the same onesI had set for myself. Well, I don’t really have any rightto expect them to do what I do in terms of the workhours or the effort. I have everything to win and everything to lose; it’s my business.

Get feedback from all the stakeholders, and get a look at relevant benchmarks from other indus- tries, companies, and functional areas. DO YOUR EXPECTATIONS SUPPORT YOUR VALUES? Of course, raising the right expectations applies not just to performance benchmarks but also to your team’svalues and ethical standards. If you put all your time,effort, attention, and energy into the production side, butyou don’t tie those performance targets into your organi- zation’s values and ethical expectations, you will inevita- bly face problems. The values must always guide theperformance targets! If they don’t, you’ve got an expect- ations mismatch. Use Expectations to Support Your Values I believe that no business is successful without goodprocedures. Initially, those procedures are likely toincorporate good values. What happens, though, overtime, is that as an organization grows, people forgetto expand their procedures in a way that supports the organization’s values, and as a result, some compa- nies put their employees in a bad situation: Theydon’t give them the backing or the information or theresources they need to make those values a reality. (continued )The Fourth Accountability: Establishing the Right Expectations 123 === Page 152 === E1C06 11/14/2009 10:24:58 Page 124 No organization is sustainable without values to com- plement and guide the performance expectations it gives its team members. If your organization avoids dealing with an expectations mismatch for long enough, it will inevita-bly end up facing a crisis. Let Your People Tell You When the Values Are in Conflict with the Expectation We sometimes forget that there is a potential majorproblem with expectations that are too high—thatare not in alignment with what can actually beachieved. This is where integrity starts to play a role. It may be possible that others may set your expectations higher than are realistic. At that point,you have to be willing to demonstrate enough integ-rity to push back a little and say, ‘‘You know what? Ican’t achieve at that level, and we need to talk aboutthat now.’’ If you look at the most spectacular frauds that have been committed in various business settings over thelast 20 years, you ﬁnd that there are a number of cases(continued ) You need something that says to the employee, ‘‘Look, even if the client wants to",

Now, it’s time to expand your Accountability Zone.you can trace back to the fact that people were being ‘‘held accountable’’ for achieving things they could only achieve by bending or breaking the rules. The expectations were never benchmarked. If the pres-sure gets very intense, for instance, to deliver a certainlevel of earnings per share, people may conclude thatthey have to start to bend the rules and to cheat in order to do that. That’s not what we want. We want them to have a place where they can step up and say tosomeone in authority that it’s simply not possible tohit the goal without compromising standards thatshouldn’t be compromised. They shouldn’t be pun-ished for saying that out loud. What you have to watch out for is when you develop a culture of management consistently saying,‘‘Look, we don’t care if there are no benchmarks thatsupport the idea of attaining this goal; if you’re goingto work here, you’re going to ﬁnd a way to go out and do it, and how you pull that off is your problem. Don’t bother me with the details.’’ If the expectationsbecome suddenly unachievable, or more importantly,if they were never achievable in the ﬁrst place, thenyou have to be willing to let people have an honest conversation with you about that. —Richard ChambersThe Fourth Accountability: Establishing the Right Expectations 125 === Page 154 === E1C06 11/14/2009 10:24:58 Page 126 Implement what you have learned about the fourth accountability.

For instance, if you are a manager in charge of a hotel, what could you learnfrom the cruise ship industry about expectations in theareas of customer service, restaurant management, hospitality, room service delivery time, and guest satis- faction? If you own and operate a home-based writingbusiness, what expectations could you set for yourselfin the areas of accounting, promotion/marketing, ortime management by talking to someone who operates a home-based graphic design business?

Try this simple experiment: Think of a single important, successful relationship in your own life that does not feature you making some kind of contribution or the other person making some kind of contribution to you. It should take you about 30 seconds to realize that the only relation-ships that fall into this category are dead ones. In fact, the quickest way to killa relationship is to start keeping track of all the reasons it’s not your turn to give to it and support it.The minute two people stop looking for reasons to give to each other, the relationship between those two people starts to decline. Personal accountability is not about giving back—it’s about giving! If you’re truly accountable to a personal relationship, you will give—period. You will look for reasons to serve others. How do you treat the key relationships in your life? Do you look for reasons to give, period? Or, do you look forreasons to give because you feel you owe someone some- thing? There’s a big difference, you know. The kind ofgiving that supports relationships is the giving that doesn’tthink about what’s gone before or what’s likely to comeback in return.The Fifth Accountability: Contributing to Your Relationships 133 === Page 162 === E1C07 11/14/2009 10:26:24 Page 134 Giving back is the process of giving because you have received something ﬁrst. That kind of giving is not based on the core principle of giving because it is the right thing to do. Whether you have received something ﬁrst shouldnot enter into your decision to give. The cycle of realgiving in any relationship always begins with the intent to give. Real giving has to start with someone asking, ‘‘What can I give to this relationship?’’ Why shouldn’t that someonebe you? This kind of giving always pays off in the long term.

Supporting Relationships over Time Getting is often a result of giving, but if the giving is anexpectation to get something, then it comes across asa hollow kind of giving. Most of our company’s sup-pliers turn into lifelong friends, because we reallywant to help them and help their businesses. As a result, most of our supplier relationships have gotten better and better over time.No More Excuses 134 === Page 163 === E1C07 11/14/2009 10:26:24 Page 135 There is something fundamentally human about acknowl- edging the ﬁfth accountability. We are built with the need to connect with others, the need to nurture and sustainrelationships, and the need to care and be cared about. Weare somehow more ourselves when we make a conscious choice to give something to a relationship with someone else. The relationships that matter most to us are the ones inwhich both sides are accountable, over time, for giving to the relationship for the sake of the relationship itself . Any meaningful relationship that endures over time inevitably draws on this sense of mutual accountability. The more individual accountability there is for giving within any relationship—not giving back, but giving—themore signiﬁcant the relationship is to both parties.During the recession recently, things fell off the cliff for everybody, and businesses slowed down for a lot of our suppliers. There were companies that ﬂooded the market with inventories; people were going bank-rupt. We could have bought that inventory andchanged suppliers over and over again, but we de-cided that we are going to stick with the long term, stay with the people who had helped us to put together a winning formula, and support our long-term suppli-ers. We built a plan together with our key supplier towin in our market. That plan didn’t make them liqui-date their entire inventory, because we knew thatwasn’t a good approach in the long term. We decided that we weren’t going to play that game, and we decided we were going to commit to the relationship. —Jeff BoothThe Fifth Accountability: Contributing to Your Relationships 135 === Page 164 === E1C07 11/14/2009 10:26:24 Page 136 YOUR SPHERE OF CONTRIBUTION MODELS YOUR VALUES In your personal life, what are you doing to support the people you love and care about?Supporting Relationships over Time Managing relationships will always be an essentialpart of leadership.

Whenever you act as a leader, you have to make sure you keep your people on board—people who may agree or disagree with the course you’repursuing at any given moment. It’s a little like amarriage. You can’t simply ignore your spouse. In our case, we were negotiating a new constitution on behalf of 42 million people. Managing relationships in that situation is not always easy. In fact, it’s often easier to negotiate with your opponents than withthose who are supposed to be your supporters. Youhave to work hard on an ongoing basis to stay con-nected, because you need people who are close to you and who will tell you what you need to hear, even though it may not be what you want to hear. You wantclose counterparts—people who are willing to betransparent in their thinking; people who are preparedto share what they think and accountable for what they have said to you in the past. —Roelf MeyerNo More Excuses 136 === Page 165 === E1C07 11/14/2009 10:26:24 Page 137 If you’re a salesperson, what are you doing proactively to connect and reconnect with your clients? If you’re in management, what are you doing to ﬁnd out what’s going on in the lives of the people on your team? What are you doing to help them achieve their goals? Building relationships is about choices, and the choices should always be based on your values. To get a ﬁx on your values, ask yourself: How can I best serve this relationship in the short term and the long term? Posing that question on a consistent basis allows you to createa group of values-based connections, which I call yoursphere of contribution . When you’re expanding your sphere of contribution, you’re not focused on short-term agendas. Serving effec-tively in both the short and long terms becomes youroverarching purpose—your standard for managing all ofyour relationships. Once you’re committed to serving ef-fectively, your decisions suddenly get a whole lot easier, because your best values are driving the actions that serve the people you’re connected to. When I’m training senior executives in the ‘‘No More Excuses’’ program to create a culture of accountability intheir organization, they often ask me about the best ways to cultivate ethical, responsible, transparent decision making.

So, howdo you do that? Well, you do it in small ways and big ways, and you start by recognizing that the caring doesn’t stop with our relationships with the students.If we don’t exhibit that caring internally, we can’tpossibly show it to our students. So, for instance,we just built a building that was supposed to cost$40 million; it ended up costing over $60 million.

Suppose you’re a salesperson taking an important client out to lunch. Granted, you’re having lunch because this individual is a client. If you’re truly connected to thatperson as a person, however, and if you’re truly lookingfor ways to support and make contributions to the rela- tionship, more often than not, you will ﬁnd that the business will take care of itself! This is the secret ofmost successful sales careers: The salesperson caresabout the customer as a person and is personally account-able for looking for ways to make contributions to therelationship. As you grow your relationships, you inevitably grow your sphere of contribution. For this book, I interviewed alot of people—many of whom reached out to other peoplewho were intrigued by the possibility of taking part in theproject. I was introduced to people from all over the world and from all walks of life who were as enthusiastic as I was about the subject of accountability. By the time I wasdone writing the book, I had many more relationshipsthan I had when I started out and many more opportuni-ties to give. Don’t get distracted by networking. Just keep looking for new ways to give and new contributions you can maketo the relationships that you have in your life. Your sphere of contribution will grow and thrive, and so will you . The more focused you are on giving for the sake of giving , the better off everyone in your sphere of contributionwill be. Supporting relationships with stakeholders is an art, not a science.

If you can’t give money, give your time, or give your attention. Time is just as good as money, and in many cases, probably a lot better.

His name was Andrew. I worked with him for two straight years, every Satur- day, and at the end of our time together, he was enrolling in technical school. He wasn’t on drugs; hewasn’t stealing anything; he wasn’t hanging out withthe wrong crowd. He was on the right track. Lookingback, I like to think the time we spent together on Saturday afternoons was a part of him being on the right track. That wasn’t any kind of ﬁnancial gift at all.It was just deciding to spend time with Andrew insteadof watching the ball game on Saturday afternoon. Everybody has some time to give. Nobody is that busy. If you think you don’t have time to give, just keep track of the amount of time you spend watching TV or looking at YouTube. Everybody is given 24 hours in aday, 365 days a year. The question is, what do we wantto do with those 24 hours? You can choose to make adifference with your time. One really important rule when it comes to giving is follow-through. If you say you are going to do some-thing, then show up and do it. Anyone can talk aboutgiving; not everyone actually gives. I have a littlesaying: ‘‘Talk is cheap; whiskey costs money.’’ So, don’t just talk! Put something on the table after you make a commitment, whether it’s money or your owninvolvement or a combination of the two. Find something you can make a commitment to— and then follow through on that commitment.

Your primary accountability: Identify at least three instances when you have reached out to help someone with no expectation of receiving help in return. If youcan’t think of three, make those three contributions right now! Individual focus: Pick one person who is extremely close to you and one person who isn’t.

The wealth of great material at my disposal meant that I had to think carefully about what I wanted to include in this chapter. I decided to focus on a topic that is near and dearto my heart and important to every person I interviewed: expanding the team’s Accountability Zone over time by creating a long-term culture of accountability within the enterprise. Everyone I interviewed for this book was a leader. Everyone I talked to was interested in making accountabil-ity a day-to-day organizational reality, not a fad or a trend or even a high priority for a single project. Everyone I talked to had already spent a great deal of time thinkingabout the very best ways of making accountability a way 155 === Page 184 === E1C08 11/14/2009 10:27:36 Page 156 of doing business and an operating philosophy over both the short and the long term that supports the organization’s mission. Maybe you’re curious as well: How doyou implement accountability in the long run? How do you make it part of your culture? How do you keep what you’ve learned aboutthe Five Accountabilities from becoming something you talk about but don’t actually do? How do you ensure that ac- countability actually gets woven into your own life, the livesof your loved ones, and ideally, the daily life of everyonewith whom you interact in the workplace during the day? On the following pages, you will ﬁnd some of my favorite responses to these questions. Implement what follows, and make accountability a consistent part of your own organi-zation’s culture!

If you are a leader, it is your responsibility to share the ‘‘why’’ behind your organization’s strategic intent and todo so in a compelling way. Do They Know Why They’re Doing What They’re Doing? First of all, you must treat your employees like humanbeings; you must make them feel that they’re actuallypart of the business. That means making sure they’refully aware of what the business is: why it runs the way it does, how its investments work, who the stake- holders are, and why it makes sense for them to pulltogether and maximize their advantage. Particularly inthe African context, we have a lot of work to do on thisfront. Many of our mine workers see themselves simply as hands. I’ll ask people, ‘‘What are you doing in this business?’’ And they’ll say, ‘‘I’m here to sell myhands.’’ They don’t see themselves as human. They’rea pair of hands that can be rented.

Do people in your organization know that they willbe praised, not punished, for admitting that they don’tknow something? Do you make a point of giving people public praise for identifying major problems so that the intelligence of the enterprise as a whole can be applied tothe problem?No Satisfaction, No Progress Often, people don’t take enough intrinsic satisfactionout of process. Woody Allen once said that 80 percentof success is showing up. I think a lot of the time wedon’t stop to ask ourselves why people sometimes don’t even bother to show up. It’s because there’s no satisfaction in executing the process. If I actually have self-accountability with the short- term tactics that support my goal, I should be taking satisfaction in consistently executing that process.That has to be one of the things the process does:reengage me. I may still be nine years from my ulti- mate goal, but if I don’t take some kind of pleasure in the process of executing, there’s going to be this senseof inertia. Time will pass, and I may be sitting in thesame place I was four years earlier.

If you want people to develop full accountability, youmust make it easy for them to answer for both successesand failures and to look for learning opportunities in both.(By the way, they’ll learn a lot more from their failures than from their successes.) A Lesson from Africa Our company culture is built around a native African phrase: ‘‘Sikhula KunYe,’’ meaning ‘‘We grow together.’’This is an idea we talk about almost every day: We tryto empower people to make and design their own plansand then execute on those plans. We understand thatthis freedom also carries with it the burden of account- ability. So, it may be a bit of an expensive freedom, but it’s the kind of freedom we want everyone to have—notjust leaders or middle management. We want all of our people to be able to think for themselves, to be honest about both successes and failures, and to learn from what’s happening. We want honest feedback, because we think that’s the only wayfor people to learn and for the organization to learn.Blame doesn’t come into play in our company except inreally extraordinary situations, like corruption or gross negligence. Those are quite rare, of course. Beyond those situations, we try not to blame anybody for any-thing.

Not everyone on your team will need this kind of ‘‘accountability mentor,’’ but you should constantly beasking yourself who does and be prepared to play that rolewhen it is appropriate.what that group as a whole is trying to accomplish, andthen we look at the individuals within that group and say, ‘‘How can you contribute to the success of the real estate group this year? What are the ﬁve or six impor-tant things you should do to help the unit achieve itsgoals?’’ Then, we have a process throughout the next12 months where there is a progress review. You need a counselor who leads the discussion and helps you review your progress on your plan, so youcan remain accountable to that and see what progressyou’re actually making. I have a counselor, and sodoes every single person in the ﬁrm. —Jim Castellano I Am Accountable to You! Rich DeVos is the owner of our team and the cofounderof the Amway organization.

One morning, Rich said, ‘‘Anthony, you know you don’t have to call me like this.’’ And Anthonysaid, ‘‘Yes I do, because I am accountable to you—yougive the ministry this money, I have to be accountableto you for that.’’ Rich loves to tell that story; the point, Ithink, is that all of us are accountable to someone. —Pat Williams Beyond Following the Rules?

I’d prefer to talkabout principles. I’d prefer to throw the rulebooks out as much as you possibly can and then tell people what the organization’s core values are. In this model,you’re saying something very different to the team:‘‘Here’s how we interact with each other, here’s howwe interact with a customer, and here’s what we wantto achieve. Go make that happen.’’ To the degree that it’s possible, you want to give people the freedom to take action as they see ﬁt within the broad outlines ofthose principles and give them the freedom to do whatthey think is right. Of course, this is a challenge. A lotof people in any organization are going to feel a little uncomfortable with that standard, and there will occasionally be problems you need to sort out. ButI think that there is a much bigger upside waiting foryour customers and for your business when you givepeople the authority to navigate in a way that feels comfortable to them. Ultimately, what you really want people to think about is what they need to do to follow through on the values you’ve established for your organization.There are probably 30 important meetings going onhere at any given time, and I am not going to be in all of those meetings.

Each of these successful individuals had a powerful shared cause with the other achievers I was interviewing:Each was on a mission to recruit new accountable peopleby helping them to recognize and expand their own Ac-countability Zones. Each of these Accountability Masterswas saying, ‘‘There are accountable people, and there is everyone else. Join us!’’ This ‘‘accountability cause’’ transcended even their own personal or professional intentions. In fact, this cause supported everything they did. It enriched every alliancethey made, supported every project they undertook, and invigorated every goal. It transformed their very sense of self. They all loved talking about people they had inspiredto reclaim long-dormant Accountability Zones. Each of these people, I realized, was an active participant in what amounted to a global movement: the movement to build accountability into families, organizations, and na- tions, one person at a time. They each supported that 175 === Page 204 === E1BOTH 11/14/2009 10:31:41 Page 176 movement by expanding their own Accountability Zone and by spreading the word about the power of the Five Accountabilities to others. My challenge to you as we close is simple: Join our movement. Become a highly accountable person. Implement the Five Accountabilities in your own life, and share themessage with others. Then, share your stories about build- ing a culture of accountability within your own family, inthe workplace, and in the larger world.

That means practicing and implementing what you’ve learned here about right things, new space,managing the process, establishing expectations, and con-tributing to relationships. It means reaching the point inyour life where you can say, ‘‘ No More Excuses!

These prin- ciples and traits are the common currency of successful individuals and businesses across virtually every industry and culture. When organizations embrace accountability at all levels, performances improve and competitive advantages emerge. When you willingly accept and embrace the ﬁ ve accountabilities, you encourage account- ability in others and empower your teams to achieve at the highest level. The result is an organization focused on its fundamental values and committed, at the individual level, to achieving critical strategic goals. Whether you’re a business owner, a top executive, or a team leader, accountability starts with you and trickles down to everyone else. If you want to build an organization that achieves its goals and beats the",

Notes About the Author === Page 7 === PREFACE FOR THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION What a difference a decade makes. When I set out to write The First 90 Days in 2001, little was out there about getting up to speed in new roles or onboarding new hires (hereafter “leadership transitions”). 1 At the time, I was teaching negotiation and corporate diplomacy at Harvard Business School. Although I had coauthored a modestly successful book on senior executive transitions in 1999 — Right from the Start with Dan Ciampa—I had been counseled by my colleagues at HBS that it was a risky career move to focus further on the subject. 2 While I appreciated their advice, in the end I decided to push forward to write the book. Leadership transitions were just too interesting and ripe for study; it was virtually an untilled field from both intellectual and practical points of view. Also in late 1999, soon after the publication of Right from the Start , I had been asked by Johnson & Johnson’s corporate management development group to develop workshops and coaching processes to accelerate the company’s leaders in transition. This work soon evolved into an engaging development partnership, and J&J became a test bed for the development and deployment of my ideas. The First 90 Days was a distillation of what I had learned during roughly two and a half years of working with hundreds of",

The book built on some foundational ideas developed in Right from the Start ; for example the importance of accelerating learning, securing early wins, and creating alliances. However, the ideas had been augmented, tested, modified, and turned into practical frameworks and tools for helping leaders at all levels accelerate their transitions. It was that distillation—the mix of concepts, tools, cases, and practical advice—that really hit the mark with leaders in transition. I had the wonderful experience of seeing sales of The First 90 Days , which was published in November 2003, take off like a rocket. By the summer of 2004, the book was on the BusinessWeek best-seller list; it stayed there for fifteen months. This success coincided fortuitously with my departure from Harvard and fueled my decision not to seek another academic position. Instead I cofounded a leadership development company—Genesis Advisers—dedicated to helping companies accelerate everyone who is taking new roles. Business books, even highly successful ones, tend to sell strongly for a year or two and then fade. This has not been the case for The First 90 Days . I have had the pleasure of seeing the book sell strongly for a decade, having so far sold almost eight hundred thousand copies in English, including seventy-five thousand in 2011. For the past ten years, the book has consistently remained among Harvard Business Review Press’s best-sellers. It has also been translated into twenty-seven languages and was the basis for Leadership Transitions , Harvard Business Publishing’s award- winning e-learning tool. 3 Enduring success of this kind has qualified The First 90 Days to be labeled a “business classic.” === Page 8 === The term “classic” evokes a whiff of mustiness with which I am not entirely comfortable. Nonetheless, I was honored in 2009 to have the book named one of the 100 best business books of all time after an extensive review by Jack Covert and Todd Sattersten at 800-CEO-READ. That recognition was a mark not only of the importance and staying power of the ideas, but also of the continuing need for every new generation of leaders to learn to make successful transitions. The success of The First 90 Days also fueled and was fueled by a rising wave of interest on the part of companies in talent management, onboarding of new hires, and",

From the outset, Genesis Advisers’ work at J&J focused on both accelerating new hires and speeding up internal promotions; I continue to believe that it is a mistake to focus just on onboarding and not on accelerating all transitions. However, it was interest in onboarding that really propelled the field forward, as the war for talent became ever more fierce, and the high costs of derailment, under- performance, and lack of retention of new hires more evident. So many companies began to adopt First 90 Days ideas to accelerate onboarding of new hires. Beyond the work we have done with our clients at Genesis Advisers, First 90 Days concepts and tools have independently been adapted and implemented by learning and development and human resources professionals in thousands of companies. In 2006 The Economist named The First 90 Days “the onboarding bible.” 4 More recently, the increasing maturity of the field has been marked by major conferences devoted to the subject of onboarding and transition acceleration. My own thinking, of course, has also evolved over the past decade, and this has resulted in numerous improvements in this new edition of the book. I have remained deeply engaged in working with leaders in transition, doing research, and translating my practical experience and findings into better frameworks and tools. Key follow-on publications include: Shaping the Game , a 2006 Harvard Business Review Press book that looks at how new leaders should apply ideas from the fields of negotiation and influence to make successful transitions. 5 The First 90 Days in Government , a version of The First 90 Days adapted to the public sector and coauthored with Peter Daly, a retired senior Treasury Department official, and Cate Reavis. 6 “The Pillars of Executive Onboarding,” an October 2008 Talent Management article on the major focal points for onboarding: business orientation, expectations, alignment, cultural adaptation, and political connection. 7 Your Next Move , a 2009 Harvard Business Review Press book that highlights the need for leaders in transition to distinguish between the organizational change challenges and the personal adaptive challenges they are confronting. It also takes a deep dive into specific types of transitions such as promotion, leading former peers, onboarding, and international moves. 8 “Picking the Right Transition Strategy,” a January 2009 Harvard Business Review article that further develops the STARS framework (start-up, turnaround, accelerated growth, realignment and sustaining success) introduced in",

Recently this has included a new generation of Acceleration Coaching process, a web-based workshop that includes virtual breakout groups, and a specialized program to help physicians transition from clinical practices and research institutions into commercial environments. I also have been gratified that The First 90 Days , and my subsequent work, have spawned so much interest in the study and practical application of transition acceleration ideas. Much excellent original research and writing has been done. 11 And, since imitation truly is the sincerest form of flattery, I have been flattered to see many of my concepts, tools, and terms adopted by other practitioners and consultants—for example, the STARS framework, transition traps, the importance of securing early wins, 12 the idea of “the fuzzy front-end” (referring to the period between getting a job and formally stepping into the role and developed jointly with Dan Ciampa), 13 and the important distinction between the organizational change challenge and the personal adaptive challenge in assessing the transition risk confronting new leaders. 14 The past ten years have been a wonderful journey, and I have many people to thank for helping to make it happen. Foremost are the two people who had the biggest impact on the early development of my ideas and their application in the real world: my Right from the Start coauthor Dan Ciampa and my partner Shawna Slack. Then there have been my editors and publishers at Harvard Business Review Press, especially Jeff Kehoe, who has been consistently wonderful in encouraging, directing, and refining my work. I also very much appreciate the support of leaders at key Genesis Advisers client companies who have been willing to take the leap and invest in our work, notably Becky Atkeison and her colleagues at FedEx and Inaki Bastarrika, Ron Bossert, Carolynn Cameron, Michael Ehret, Ted Nguyen, and Doug",

The actions you take during your first few months in a new role will largely determine whether you succeed or fail. Failure in a new assignment can spell the end of a promising career. But making a successful transition is about more than just avoiding failure. When leaders derail, their problems can almost always be traced to vicious cycles that developed in the first few months on the job. And for every leader who fails outright, there are many others who survive but do not realize their full potential. As a result, they lose opportunities to advance their careers and help their organizations thrive. Why are transitions critical? When I surveyed more than thirteen hundred senior HR leaders, almost 90 percent agreed that “transitions into new roles are the most challenging times in the professional lives of leaders.” 1 And nearly three-quarters agreed that “success or failure during the first few months is a strong predictor of overall success or failure in the job.” So even though a bad transition does not necessarily doom you to failure, it makes success a lot less likely. The good news on transitions is that they give you a chance to start afresh and make needed changes in an organization. But transitions are also periods of acute vulnerability, because you lack established working relationships and a detailed understanding of your new role. You’re managing under a microscope, subject to a high degree of scrutiny as people around you strive to figure out who you are and what you represent as a leader. Opinions of your effectiveness begin to form surprisingly quickly, and, once formed, they’re very hard to change. If you’re successful in building credibility and securing early wins, the momentum likely will propel you through the rest of your tenure. But if you dig yourself into a hole early on, you will face an uphill battle from that point forward. Building Your Career",

Leaders experience many transitions, so the ability to transition quickly and effectively into a new role has become a critical skill. In a study of 580 leaders conducted jointly by Genesis Advisers, Harvard Business Review , and the International Institute of Management Development (hereafter the Genesis/HBR/IMD study), respondents reported an average of 18.2 years of professional work experience. 2 The typical leader had been promoted 4.1 times, moved between business functions (such as from sales to marketing) 1.8 times, joined a new company 3.5 times, moved between business units in the same company 1.9 times, and moved geographically 2.2 times. This totals 13.5 major transitions per leader, or one every 1.3 years. As you will learn later, some of these transitions likely happened in parallel. But the implications are clear: every successful career is a series of successful assignments, and every successful assignment is launched with a successful transition. Beyond these easily identified milestones, leaders also experience many hidden transitions. These === Page 11 === transitions occur when there are substantial changes in leaders’ roles and responsibilities without corresponding changes in titles. These are common occurrences, often the result of organizational shifts due to rapid growth, restructuring, and acquisition. Hidden transitions can be particularly perilous, because leaders do not always recognize them or give them the attention they deserve. The most dangerous transition can be the one you don’t recognize is happening. Leaders also are impacted by the transitions of many others around them. Each year about a quarter of the managers in a typical Fortune 500 company changes jobs. 3 And each leader transition materially impacts the performance of roughly a dozen other people—bosses, peers, direct reports, and other stakeholders. 4 So even if you aren’t personally in transition, you likely are having the transitions of others inflicted on you. To see this, think about the other people in your immediate neighborhood who also are in their first 90 days. The number likely will surprise you. The problem is that even though a lot has been written and discussed about how to be a more effective leader in general, little research and writing addresses how to successfully accelerate through leadership and career transitions. People still go through these all-important career crucibles with little preparation and no reliable",

Reaching the Break-Even Point Your goal in every transition is to get as rapidly as possible to the break-even point . This is the point at which you have contributed as much value to your new organization as you have consumed from it. As shown in figure I-1 , new leaders are net consumers of value early on; as they learn and begin to take action, they begin to create value. From the break-even point onward, they are (one hopes) net contributors of value to their organizations. FIGURE I-1 The break-even point When more than two hundred company CEOs and presidents were asked for their best estimates of the time it takes a typical midlevel leader who has been promoted or hired from the outside to reach the break-even point, the average of their responses was 6.2 months. 5 Of course, there can be a === Page 12 === great deal of variation in the time it takes to reach the break-even point. If you have inherited a disaster—the classic burning platform —you may be creating value from the moment your appointment is announced. If you have been hired from the outside into a very successful organization, it may take a year or more for you to be a net value contributor. However, even though the time varies (and I explore in depth the challenges of different types of transitions), the goal is the same: to get there as quickly and effectively as possible. This book provides a blueprint for dramatically condensing the time it takes you to reach the break-even point, regardless of your level in your organization. In fact, independent research has shown that you can reduce the time by as much as 40 percent through rigorous application of the principles described in this book. 6 Avoiding Transition Traps Like most leaders, you’ve probably learned to make transitions in the school of hard knocks—trying things, making mistakes, and ultimately winning through. In the process, you’ve developed approaches that have worked for you… at least until now. But what works well in some situations doesn’t work in others, and you may not figure that out until it’s too late. That’s why it is crucial to follow a comprehensive framework for making transitions, one that distills the experience of many leaders facing a diverse range",

Consider, for example, the following list of common traps, developed through interviews with experienced leaders and supplemented by responses to questions in the Genesis/HBR/IMD study. As you look at the list, think about your own experience. Sticking with what you know . You believe you will be successful in the new role by doing the same things you did in your previous role, only more so. You fail to see that success in the new role requires you to stop doing some things and to embrace new competencies. Falling prey to the “action imperative.” You feel as if you need to take action, and you try too hard, too early to put your own stamp on the organization. You are too busy to learn, and you make bad decisions and catalyze resistance to your initiatives. Setting unrealistic expectations. You don’t negotiate your mandate or establish clear, achievable objectives. You may perform well but still fail to meet the expectations of your boss and other key stakeholders. Attempting to do too much. You rush off in all directions, launching multiple initiatives in the hope that some will pay off. People become confused, and no critical mass of resources gets focused on key initiatives. Coming in with “the” answer. You come in with your mind made up, or you reach conclusions too quickly about “the” problems and “the” solutions. You alienate people who could help you understand what’s going on, and you squander opportunities to develop support for good solutions. === Page 13 === Engaging in the wrong type of learning. You spend too much time focused on learning about the technical part of the business and not enough about the cultural and political dimensions of your new role. You don’t build the cultural insight, relationships, and information conduits you need if you’re to understand what is really going on. Neglecting horizontal relationships. You spend too much time focused on vertical relationships—up to the boss and down to direct reports—and not enough on peers and other stakeholders. You don’t fully understand what it will take to succeed, and you miss early opportunities to build supportive alliances. Have you fallen into any of these traps in the past? Have you seen others do so? Now think about your new role. Are you in danger of making any of these mistakes? To help avoid derailment and get to the break-even point faster,",

Creating Momentum Each of these traps enmeshes its victims in a vicious cycle (see figure I-2 ). By failing to learn the right things in the right ways at the outset, for example, you can make bad initial decisions that damage your credibility. Then, because people don’t trust your judgment, it can become still more difficult to learn what you need to know. You consume energy compensating for early miscalculations, and the downward spiral takes hold. But your objective is not only to avoid vicious cycles; you need to create virtuous cycles that help you create momentum and establish an upward spiral of increasing effectiveness (see figure I-3 ). Good initial decisions founded on the right kind of learning, for example, bolster your personal credibility. As people come to trust your judgment, your ability to learn accelerates, and you equip yourself to make sound calls on tougher issues. FIGURE I-2 The vicious cycle of transitions === Page 14 === FIGURE I-3 The virtuous cycle of transitions Your overriding goal in getting up to speed and taking charge is to generate momentum by creating virtuous cycles, and to avoid getting caught in vicious cycles that damage your credibility. Leadership ultimately is about influence and leverage. You are, after all, only one person. To be successful, you need to mobilize the energy of many others in your organization. If you do the right things, then your vision, your expertise, and your drive can propel you forward and serve as seed crystals. If you don’t, you can end up caught in negative feedback loops from which it may be difficult or impossible to === Page 15 === escape. Understanding the Fundamental Principles The root causes of transition failure always lie in a pernicious interaction between the new role, with its opportunities and pitfalls, and the individual, with his strengths and vulnerabilities. Failure is never only about the flaws of the new leader. Indeed, all the failed leaders I studied had achieved significant successes in the past. Nor is it only about a no-win situation in which not even a superhuman leader could have carried the day. The business situations facing leaders who derail are no tougher than those in which others succeed brilliantly. Transition failures happen because new leaders either misunderstand the essential demands of the situation or lack the skill and",

The good news is that there are systematic methods you can employ to both lessen the likelihood of failure and reach the break-even point faster. The specific business situations that confront transitioning leaders vary. But specific types of transition situations, such as start-ups and turnarounds, share certain features and imperatives. Further, there are fundamental principles—for example, securing early wins—that underpin success in all transitions at all levels. The key, then, is to match your strategy to the situation. More than a decade’s worth of research and practice has shown that you can dramatically accelerate your transition into your new role. Do the right things—the essential transition tasks listed next—and you will rapidly create momentum that will propel you to even greater successes. Prepare yourself. This means making a mental break from your old job and preparing to take charge in the new one. Perhaps the biggest pitfall you face is assuming that what has made you successful to this point will continue to do so. The dangers of sticking with what you know, working extremely hard at doing it, and failing miserably are very real. Accelerate your learning. You need to climb the learning curve as fast as you can in your new organization. This means understanding its markets, products, technologies, systems, and structures, as well as its culture and politics. Learning about a new organization can feel like drinking from a fire hose. You must be systematic and focused about deciding what you need to learn and how you will learn it most efficiently. Match your strategy to the situation. Different types of situations require you to make significant adjustments in how you plan for and execute your transition. Start-ups, for instance—of a new product, process, plant, or business—present challenges quite different from those you would face while turning around a product, process, or plant in serious trouble. A clear diagnosis of the situation is an essential prerequisite for developing your action plan. Secure early wins. Early wins build your credibility and create momentum. They create virtuous cycles that leverage the energy you put into the organization to create a pervasive sense that good things are happening. In the first few weeks, you need to identify opportunities to build personal credibility. In the first 90 days, you need to identify ways to create value and improve business results that will help you get to",

Because no other single relationship is more important, you need to figure out how to build a productive working relationship with your new boss (or bosses) and manage her expectations. This means carefully planning for a series of critical conversations about the situation, expectations, working style, resources, and your personal development. Crucially, it means developing and gaining consensus on your 90-day plan. Achieve alignment. The higher you rise in an organization, the more you must play the role of organizational architect. This means figuring out whether the organization’s strategic direction is sound, bringing its structure into alignment with its strategy, and developing the processes and skill bases necessary to realize your strategic intent. Build your team. If you are inheriting a team, you need to evaluate, align, and mobilize its members. You likely also need to restructure it to better meet the demands of the situation. Your willingness to make tough early personnel calls and your capacity to select the right people for the right positions are among the most important drivers of success during your transition and beyond. You need to be both systematic and strategic in approaching the team- building challenge. Create coalitions. Your success depends on your ability to influence people outside your direct line of control. Supportive alliances, both internal and external, are necessary if you are to achieve your goals. You therefore should start right away to identify those whose support is essential for your success, and to figure out how to line them up on your side. Keep your balance. In the personal and professional tumult of a transition, you must work hard to maintain your equilibrium and preserve your ability to make good judgments. The risks of losing perspective, becoming isolated, and making bad calls are ever present during transitions. There is much you can do to accelerate your personal transition and to gain more control over your work environment. The right advice-and-counsel network is an indispensable resource. Accelerate everyone. Finally, you need to help all those in your organization—direct reports, bosses, and peers—accelerate their own transitions. The fact that you’re in transition means they are too. The quicker you can get your new direct reports up to speed, the more you will help your own performance. Beyond that, the potential benefits to the organization of systematically accelerating everyone’s transitions are vast.",

You will learn how to diagnose your situation and create action plans tailored to your needs, regardless of your level in the organization or the business situation you face. In the process you will build a 90-day plan that will accelerate you into your new role. Assessing Transition Risk The first step is to diagnose the types of transitions you’re going through. Whether you’re preparing to interview for a new position or have taken a new role, this is the starting point for applying the === Page 17 === fundamental principles. Promotion and onboarding into new companies are the most frequent shifts. However, most leaders taking new roles experience multiple transitions in parallel—for example, joining a new company and moving to a new location, or being promoted and moving from a functional to a cross-functional role. In fact, participants in the executive programs we studied reported on average experiencing 2.2 major shifts (such as getting a promotion, joining a new company, moving between business units, moving geographically) the last time they took new roles. 7 This complexity adds to the transition challenge—and the risk of derailing—and it means it is critical for you to understand the types of transitions you’re experiencing and to identify which shifts you are finding most challenging. A simple way to do this is to complete the Transition Risk Assessment in table I-1 . Mapping Out Your First 90 Days Your transition begins the moment you learn you are being considered for a new job (see figure I-4 for key transition milestones). When it ends depends very much on the situation you face. No matter what kind of transition you’re making, by roughly the three-month mark key people in the organization —your bosses, peers, and direct reports—typically expect you to be getting some traction. Thus, you should use the 90-day period as a planning horizon. Doing so will help you confront the need to operate in a compressed time frame. If you’re lucky, you may get some lead time between learning you’re being considered and actually sitting in the chair. Use that time to begin educating yourself about your organization. No matter how much preparation time you get, start planning what you hope to accomplish by specific milestones. Even a few hours of preentry planning can",

Then move to the first week. Then focus on the end of the first month, the second month, and finally the three-month mark. These plans will be sketchy, but the simple act of beginning to plan will help clear your head. TABLE I-1 Transition Risk Assessment To transition effectively, first identify the risks you face as you move into your new role using the Transition Risk Assessment. Start by checking off the types of transitions you are experiencing using the middle column. Then, for each item you checked, assess how challenging you are finding that particular shift on a 1–10 scale, where 1 means very easy and 10 means very difficult. Total the numbers in the right-hand column to get your Transition Risk Index (up to 100). The index gives you a sense of the magnitude of the challenge and the specific dimensions of your overall transition on which you most need to focus. === Page 18 === FIGURE I-4 Key transition milestones Hitting the Ground Running This book is for new leaders at all levels, from first-time managers to CEOs. The fundamental principles of effective transition acceleration hold up well across all levels. Every new leader needs to quickly become familiar with the new organization, secure early wins, and build supportive coalitions. That’s why this book provides guidelines for translating principles into plans tailored to === Page 19 === your own situation. As you continue through it, you should read actively, making notes about the applicability of specific points to your situation, as well as thinking about how the advice should be customized to your situation.

What are the key elements and milestones in your 90-day plan? === Page 20 === CHAPTER 1 Prepare Yourself After eight years in marketing at a leading consumer electronics company, Julia Gould was promoted to lead a major new product development project. Up to that point, her track record had been stellar. Her intelligence, focus, and determination had won her recognition and early promotion to increasingly senior positions. The company had designated her as a high-potential and had positioned her on the fast track to senior leadership. Julia was assigned to be the launch manager for one of the company’s hottest new products. It was her responsibility to coordinate the work of a cross-functional team drawn from marketing, sales, R&D, and manufacturing. The goal: to seamlessly move the product from R&D to production, oversee a rapid ramp-up, and streamline the market introduction. Unfortunately, Julia ran into trouble early on. Her earlier success in marketing was the result of extraordinary attention to detail. Accustomed to managing with authority and making the calls, she had a high need for control and a tendency to micromanage. When she tried to continue making decisions, members of the team initially said nothing. But soon two key members challenged her knowledge and authority. Stung, she focused on the area she knew best: the marketing aspects of the launch. Her efforts to micromanage the members of the marketing team alienated them. Within a month and a half, Julia was back in marketing, and someone else was leading the team. Julia failed because she did not make the leap from being a strong functional performer to taking on a cross-functional, project-leadership role. She failed to grasp that the strengths that had made her successful in marketing could be liabilities in a role that required her to lead without direct authority or superior expertise. She kept doing what she knew how to do, making her feel confident and in control. The result, of course, was the opposite. By not letting go of the past and not fully embracing her new role, she squandered a big opportunity to rise in the organization.",

You can exist in a state of denial, believing that because you’re being efficient, you’re being effective. You may keep believing this until the moment the walls come crashing down around you. What might Julia have done differently? She should have focused on better preparing herself for the new position. At the broadest level, preparing yourself means letting go of the past and embracing the imperatives of the new situation to give yourself a running start. It can be hard work, but it is essential. Often, promising managers fail in new roles because they’ve failed to prepare themselves === Page 21 === by embracing the necessary changes in perspective. The starting point for preparing yourself is to understand the types of transitions you’re experiencing. To illustrate the challenges associated with different types of transitions (discussed in the introduction), I focus here on the two most frequently experienced types of transitions: promotions and onboarding into new companies. Getting Promoted A promotion marks the result of years of hard work to persuade influential people in the organization that you’re willing and able to move to the next level. But it also marks the beginning of a new journey. You must figure out what it takes to be excellent in the new role, how to exceed the expectations of those who promoted you, and how to position yourself for still greater things. Specifically, every promotion presents new leaders with a core set of challenges to be surmounted. Balance Breadth and Depth Each time you’re promoted, your horizon broadens to encompass a wider set of issues and decisions. So you need to gain and sustain a high-level perspective in your new role. To be successful, Julia needed to shift her focus from her marketing function to the full array of issues relating to the product launch. You also need to learn to strike the right balance between keeping the wide view and drilling down",

This juggling act can be challenging, because what had been the fifty-thousand- foot view in your previous role may be equivalent to the world at five thousand feet, or even five hundred feet, in your new job. Rethink What You Delegate The complexity and ambiguity of the issues you are dealing with increase every time you get promoted. So you’ll need to rethink what you delegate. No matter where you land, the keys to effective delegation remain much the same: you build a team of competent people whom you trust, you establish goals and metrics to monitor their progress, you translate higher-level goals into specific responsibilities for your direct reports, and you reinforce them through process. When you get promoted, however, what you delegate usually needs to change. If you’re leading an organization of five people, it may make sense to delegate specific tasks such as drafting a piece of marketing material or selling to a particular customer. In an organization of fifty people, your focus may shift from tasks to projects and processes. At five hundred people, you often need to delegate responsibility for specific products or platforms. And at five thousand people, your direct reports may be responsible for entire businesses. Influence Differently Conventional wisdom says that the higher you go, the easier it is to get things done. Not necessarily. Paradoxically, when you get promoted, positional authority often becomes less important for pushing agendas forward. Like Julia, you may indeed gain increased scope to influence decisions that affect === Page 22 === the business, but the way you need to engage may be quite different. Decision making becomes more political—less about authority, and more about influence. That isn’t good or bad; it’s simply inevitable. There are two major reasons this is so. First, the issues you’re dealing with become much more complex and ambiguous when you move up a level—and your ability to identify “right” answers based solely on data and analysis declines correspondingly. Decisions are shaped more by others’ expert judgments and who trusts whom, as well as by networks of mutual support. Second, at a higher level of the organization, the other players are more capable and have stronger egos. Remember, you were promoted because you are able and driven; the same is true for everyone around you. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the decision-making game becomes much more",

It’s critical, then, for you to become more effective at building and sustaining alliances. Communicate More Formally The good news about moving up is that you get a broader view of the business and more latitude to shape it. The bad news is that you are farther from the front lines and more likely to receive filtered information. To avoid this, you need to establish new communication channels to stay connected with what is happening where the action is. You might maintain regular, direct contact with select customers, for instance, or meet regularly with groups of frontline employees, all without undermining the integrity of the chain of command. You also need to establish new channels for communicating your strategic intent and vision across the organization—convening town-hall–type meetings rather than individual or small-group sessions, or using electronic communication to broadcast your messages to the widest possible audiences. Your direct reports should play a greater role in communicating your vision and ensuring the spread of critical information—something to remember when you’re evaluating the leadership skills of the team members you’ve inherited. Exhibit the Right Presence “All the world’s a stage,” as William Shakespeare put it in the play As You Like It , “and all the men and women merely players.” One inescapable reality of promotion is that you attract much more attention and a higher level of scrutiny than before. You become the lead actor in a crucial public play. Private moments become fewer, and there is mounting pressure to exhibit the right kind of leadership presence at all times. That’s why it’s important to get an early fix on what “leadership presence” means in your new role: what does a leader look like at your new level in the hierarchy? How does he act? What kind of personal leadership brand do you want to have in the new role? How will you make it your own? These are critical considerations, worth taking the time to explore. These core promotion challenges are summarized in figure 1-1 . Onboarding into a New Company === Page 23 === In promotion situations, leaders typically understand a lot about their organizations but must develop the behaviors and competencies required to be effective at new levels.

Their difficulties lie in adjusting to new organizational contexts that have different political structures and cultures. FIGURE 1-1 Core promotion challenges For each core challenge there are corresponding strategies that newly promoted leaders should employ. To illustrate, consider the experience of David Jones at Energix, a small, rapidly growing wind energy company. David was recruited from a highly regarded global manufacturing firm. An engineer by training, David had risen steadily through the ranks in R&D to become vice president of new- product development for the company’s electrical distribution division. David learned to lead in a company that was renowned for its leadership bench strength. The culture leaned toward a command- and-control style of leadership, but people were still expected to speak their minds—and did. The company had long been a leader in the adoption and refinement of process-management methodologies, including total quality management, lean manufacturing, and six sigma. As the new head of R&D at Energix, David entered a company that had weathered the typical start-up transitions—going from two people to two hundred to two thousand—and was now poised to become a major corporation. As a result, the CEO had told David more than once during the recruiting process that things had to change. “We need to become more disciplined,” the chief executive had said. “We’ve succeeded by staying focused and working as a team. We know each other, we trust each other, and we’ve come a long way together. But we need to be more systematic in how we do things, or we won’t be able to capitalize on and sustain our new size.” So David understood that his first major task would be to identify, systematize, and improve the core processes of the R&D organization—an essential first step in laying the foundation for sustained growth. David dug into the new job with his usual gusto. What he found was a company that had been run largely by the seat of its collective pants. Many important operational and financial processes were === Page 24 === not well established; others weren’t sufficiently controlled. In new-product development alone, dozens of projects had inadequate specifications or insufficiently precise milestones and deliverables. One critical project, Energix’s next-generation large turbine, was nearly a year behind schedule and way over budget. David came away from his first couple of weeks",

But then he began to hit roadblocks. The senior management committee (SMC) meetings started out frustrating and got worse. David, who was used highly disciplined meetings with clear agendas and actionable decisions, found the committee members’ elliptical discussions and consensus-driven process agonizing. Particularly troubling to him was the lack of open discussion about pressing issues and the sense that decisions were being made through back channels. When David raised a sensitive or provocative issue with the SMC, or pressed others in the room for commitments to act, people would either fall silent or recite a list of reasons why things couldn’t be done a certain way. Two months in, with his patience frayed, David decided to simply focus on what he had been hired to do: revamp the new-product development processes to support the company’s growth. So he convened a meeting of the heads of R&D, operations, and finance to discuss how to proceed. At that gathering, David presented a plan for setting up teams that would map out existing processes and conduct a thorough redesign effort. He also outlined the required resource commitments—for instance, assigning strong people from operations and finance to participate in the teams, and hiring external consultants to support the analysis. Given the conversations he’d had with the CEO during recruiting and the clear mandate he felt he’d been given, David was shocked by the stonewalling he encountered. The attendees listened but wouldn’t commit themselves or their people to David’s plan. Instead, they urged David to bring his plan before the whole SMC because it affected many parts of the company and had the potential to be disruptive if not managed carefully. (He later learned that two of the participants had gone to the CEO soon after the meeting to register their concerns; David was “a bull in a china shop,” according to one. “We have to be careful not to upset some delicate balances as we get out the next-gen turbine,” said the other. And both were of the firm opinion that “letting Jones run things might not be the right way to go.”) Even more troubling, David experienced a noticeable and worrisome chill in his relationship with the CEO. Joining a new company is akin to an organ transplant—and you’re",

If you’re not thoughtful in adapting to the new situation, you could end up being attacked by the organizational immune system and rejected. Witness David’s challenges at Energix. When surveyed, senior HR practitioners overwhelmingly assess the challenge of coming in from the outside as “much harder” than being promoted from within. 1 They attribute the high failure rate of outside hires to several barriers, notably the following: Leaders from outside the company are not familiar with informal networks of information and communication. Outside hires are not familiar with the corporate culture and therefore have greater difficulty navigating. === Page 25 === New people are unknown to the organization and therefore do not have the same credibility as someone who is promoted from within. A long tradition of hiring from within makes it difficult for some organizations to accept outsiders. To overcome these barriers and succeed in joining a new company, you should focus on four pillars of effective onboarding: business orientation, stakeholder connection, alignment of expectations, and cultural adaptation. Business Orientation Business orientation is the most straightforward part of onboarding. The sooner you understand the business environment in which you’re operating, the sooner you can make productive contributions. Getting oriented to the business means learning about the company as a whole and not only your specific parts of the business. As you work to understand the organization, it’s worth thinking beyond simply the financials, products, and strategy. Regardless of your position, for example, it’s beneficial to learn about the brands and products you will be supporting, whether or not you’re directly involved in sales and marketing. Focus, too, on understanding the operating model, planning and performance evaluation systems, and talent management systems, because they often powerfully influence how you can most effectively have an impact. Stakeholder Connection It’s also essential to develop the right relationship wiring as soon as possible. This means identifying key stakeholders and building productive working relationships. As with David, there is a natural but dangerous tendency for new leaders to focus on building vertical relationships early in their transitions—up to their bosses and down to their teams. Often, insufficient time is devoted to lateral relationship building with peers and key constituencies outside the new leader’s immediate organization. Remember: you don’t want to be meeting your neighbors for the first time in the middle of the night when your house is burning down. Expectations",

Why? Because understandings that are developed before you join—about mandates, support, and resources—may not prove to be fully accurate once you’re in the job. It isn’t that you’ve been actively misled; rather, it’s because recruiting is like romance, and employment is like marriage. As David learned, newly hired leaders can easily come to believe that they have more latitude to make changes than is actually the case. If they act on these sorts of incorrect assumptions, they easily can trigger unnecessary resistance and even derail themselves. It also is important to understand and factor in the expectations of key constituencies other than your new boss—for example, key people in finance at corporate headquarters if you’re working in a business unit. This is especially the case if they’re likely to influence how you’re evaluated and === Page 26 === rewarded. Cultural Adaptation The most daunting challenge for leaders joining new organizations is adapting to unfamiliar cultures. For David, this meant making the transition from an authority-driven, process-focused culture to a consensus-oriented, relational one. To adapt successfully, you need to understand what the culture is overall and how it’s manifested in the organization or unit you’re joining (because different units may have different subcultures). In doing this, it helps to think of yourself as an anthropologist sent to study a newly discovered civilization. What is culture ? It’s a set of consistent patterns people follow for communicating, thinking, and acting, all grounded in their shared assumptions and values. The culture in any organization is generally multilayered, as illustrated in figure 1-2 . At the top of the culture pyramid are the surface elements—the symbols, shared languages, and other things most visible to outsiders. Obvious symbols include organizational logos, the way people dress, and the way office space is organized and allocated. Likewise, every organization typically has a shared language—a long list of acronyms, for instance, describing business units, products, processes, projects, and other elements of the company. So it’s essential that you invest early on in learning to speak like the locals. At this level, it’s relatively easy for newcomers to figure out how to fit in. If people at your level don’t wear plaid, then you shouldn’t either, unless you’re trying to signal",

FIGURE 1-2 The culture pyramid Beneath the surface layer of symbols and language lies a deeper, less visible set of organizational norms and accepted patterns of behavior. These elements of culture include things like how people get support for important initiatives, how they win recognition for their accomplishments, and how they view meetings—are they seen as forums for discussion or rubber-stamp sessions? (See the box “Identifying Cultural Norms.”) These norms and patterns often are difficult to discern and become evident only after you’ve spent some time in a new environment. And finally, underlying all cultures are the fundamental assumptions that everyone has about the === Page 27 === way the world works—the shared values that infuse and reinforce all the other elements in the pyramid. A good example is the general beliefs people in the company have about the right way to distribute power based on position. Are executives in particular roles given lots of decision-making power from Day 1, or is the degree of authority a function of seniority? Or does the organization operate according to consensus, where the ability to persuade is key? Again, these elements of the culture are often invisible and can take time to become clear. Identifying Cultural Norms The following domains are areas in which cultural norms may vary significantly from company to company. Transitioning leaders should use this checklist to help them figure out how things really work in the organizations they’re joining. Influence . How do people get support for critical initiatives? Is it more important to have the support of a patron within the senior team, or affirmation from your peers and direct reports that your idea is a good one? Meetings . Are meetings filled with dialogue on hard issues, or are they simply forums for publicly ratifying agreements that have been reached in private? Execution . When it comes time to get things done, which matters more—a deep understanding of processes or knowing the right people? Conflict . Can people talk openly about difficult issues without fear of retribution? Or do they avoid conflict—or, even worse, push it to lower levels, where it can wreak havoc? Recognition . Does the company promote stars, rewarding those who visibly and vocally drive business initiatives? Or does it encourage team players, rewarding those who lead authoritatively but quietly and collaboratively? Ends versus means . Are there",

Does the organization have a well- defined, well-communicated set of values that is reinforced through positive and negative incentives? Armed with a deeper understanding of the business situation, political networks, expectations, and culture, you will be in a much stronger position to figure out how to strike the right balance between adapting to the new organization and working to alter it. See table 1-1 for issues and action items related to each of the four pillars as you onboard into a new organization. The challenges of entering new cultures arise not only when new leaders are transitioning between two different companies, but also when they move between units—the “inboarding” challenge—as well as when they make international moves. Why? It’s because both kinds of change typically require new leaders to grapple with new work cultures. The same basic approach to cultural assessment and adaptation can be applied (with suitable modifications) in these situations. 2 Preparing Yourself With a deeper understanding of the types of transition challenges you face, you can now focus on preparing yourself to make the leap. How can you be sure to meet the challenges of your new position? You can focus on basic principles for getting ready for your new role, as discussed next. TABLE 1-1 === Page 28 === Onboarding checklists Business orientation checklist As early as possible, get access to publicly available information about financials, products, strategy, and brands. Identify additional sources of information, such as websites and analyst reports. If appropriate for your level, ask the business to assemble a briefing book. If possible, schedule familiarization tours of key facilities before the formal start date. Stakeholder connection checklist Ask your boss to identify and introduce you to the key people you should connect with early on. If possible, meet with some stakeholders before the formal start. Take control of your calendar, and schedule early meetings with key stakeholders. Be careful to focus on lateral relationships (peers, others) and not only vertical ones (boss, direct reports). Expectations alignment checklist Understand and engage in business planning and performance management. No matter how well you think you understand what you need to do, schedule a conversation with your boss about expectations in your first week. Have explicit conversations about working styles with bosses and direct reports as early as possible. Cultural adaptation checklist During recruiting, ask questions about the organization’s",

Identify people inside the organization who could serve as culture interpreters. After thirty days, conduct an informal 360-degree check-in with your boss and peers to gauge how adaptation is proceeding. Establish a Clear Breakpoint The move from one position to another usually happens in a blur. You rarely get much notice before being thrust into a new job. If you’re lucky, you get a couple of weeks, but more often the move is measured in days. You get caught up in a scramble to finish your old job even as you try to wrap your arms around the new one. Even worse, you may be pressured to perform both jobs until your previous position is filled, making the line of demarcation even fuzzier. Because you may not get a clean transition in job responsibilities, it is essential to discipline yourself to make the transition mentally. Pick a specific time, such as a weekend, and use it to imagine yourself making the shift. Consciously think of letting go of the old job and embracing the new one. Think hard about the differences between the two, and consider how you must now think and act differently. Take the time to celebrate your move, even informally, with family and friends. Use the time to touch base with your informal advisers and counselors and to ask for advice. The bottom line: do whatever it takes to get into the transition state of mind. Assess Your Vulnerabilities You have been offered your new position because those who selected you think you have the skills to succeed. But as you saw in the cases of Julia Gould and David Jones, it can be fatal to rely too much === Page 29 === on what made you successful in the past. One way to pinpoint your vulnerabilities is to assess your problem preferences —the kinds of problems toward which you naturally gravitate. Everyone likes to do some things more than others. Julia’s preference was marketing; for others, it may be finance or operations. Your preferences have probably influenced you to choose jobs where you can do more of what you like to do. As a result, you’ve perfected those skills and feel most competent when you solve problems in those areas, and that reinforces the cycle. This pattern",

The risk, of course, is that you create an imbalance that leaves you vulnerable when success depends on being ambidextrous. Table 1-2 is a simple tool for assessing your preferences for different kinds of business problems. Fill in each cell by assessing your intrinsic interest in solving problems in the domain in question. In the upper-left cell, for example, ask yourself how much you like to work on appraisal and reward systems. This isn’t a comparative question; don’t compare this interest with others. Rank your interest in each cell separately, on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much). Keep in mind that you’re being asked about your intrinsic interests and not your skills or experience. Do not turn the page before completing the table. TABLE 1-2 Assessment of problem preferences Assess your intrinsic interest in solving problems in each of these domains on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 means very little interest and 10 means a great deal of interest. Now transfer your rankings from table 1-2 to the corresponding cells in table 1-3 . Then sum the three columns and the five rows. The column totals represent your preferences among technical, political, and cultural problems. === Page 30 === Technical problems encompass strategies, markets, technologies, and processes. Political problems concern power and politics in the organization. Cultural problems involve values, norms, and guiding assumptions. If one column total is noticeably lower than the others, it represents a potential blind spot for you. If you score high on technical interests and low on cultural or political interests, for example, you may be at risk of overlooking the human side of the organizational equation.

Again, these are potential blind spots. TABLE 1-3 Preferences for problems and functions The results of this diagnostic exercise should help you answer the following questions: in what spheres do you most enjoy solving problems? In what spheres are you least eager to solve problems? What are the implications for potential vulnerabilities in your new position? You can do a lot to compensate for your vulnerabilities.

You need to discipline yourself to devote time to critical activities that you do not enjoy and that may not come naturally. Beyond that, actively search out people in your organization whose skills are sharp in these areas, so that they can serve as a backstop for you and you can learn from them. A network of advisers and counselors can also help you move beyond your comfort zone. Watch Out for Your Strengths Your weaknesses can make you vulnerable, but so can your strengths. To paraphrase Abraham Maslow, “To a person with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” 3 The qualities that have made you successful so far (it’s worth being clear in your own mind what your hammer is) can prove to be weaknesses in your new role. For example, Julia was highly attentive to detail. Though clearly a strength, her attention to detail had a downside, especially in tandem with a high need for control: the result was a tendency to micromanage people in the areas she knew best. This behavior demoralized people who wanted to make their own contributions without intrusive oversight. === Page 31 === Relearn How to Learn It may have been some time since you faced a steep learning curve. “Suddenly I realized how much I didn’t know” is a common lament from leaders in transition. You may have excelled in a function or discipline, like Julia, and now find yourself in a project-leadership position. Or like David, you may be joining a new company where you lack an established network and sense of the culture. In any case, you suddenly need to learn a lot, fast. Having to start learning again can evoke long-buried and unnerving feelings of incompetence or vulnerability, especially if you suffer early setbacks. You may find yourself mentally revisiting a juncture in your career when you had less confidence. Perhaps you will make some early missteps and experience failure for the first time in ages. So you unconsciously begin to gravitate toward areas where you feel competent and toward people who reinforce your feelings of self-worth. New challenges and associated fears of incompetence can set up a vicious cycle of denial and defensiveness. Put bluntly, you can decide to learn and adapt, or you can become brittle and fail. Your failure may be dramatic, like Julia’s, or it may be",

As I discuss in the next chapter on accelerating your learning, denial and defensiveness are a sure recipe for disaster. Relearning how to learn can be stressful. So if you find yourself waking up in a cold sweat, take comfort. Most new leaders experience the same feelings. And if you embrace the need to learn, you can surmount them. Rework Your Network As you advance in your career, the advice you need changes. Preparing yourself for a new role calls for proactively restructuring your advice-and-counsel network. Early in your career, there is a premium on cultivating good technical advisers—experts in certain aspects of marketing or finance, for instance, who can help you get your work done. As you move to higher levels, however, it becomes increasingly important to get good political counsel and personal advice. Political counselors help you understand the politics of the organization, an understanding that is especially important when you plan to implement change. Personal advisers help you keep perspective and equilibrium in times of stress. Transforming your advice-and-counsel network is never easy; your current advisers may be close friends, and you may feel comfortable with technical advisers whose domains you know well. But it is essential to step back and recognize where you need to build your networks to compensate for blind spots and gaps in your own expertise or experience. Watch Out for People Who Want to Hold You Back Consciously or not, some individuals may not want you to advance. Your old boss, for example, may not want to let you go. So you must negotiate clear expectations, as soon as you know when you will be transitioning, about what you will do to close things out. This means being specific about the issues or projects that will be dealt with and to what extent—and, critically, what is not going to be done. Take notes, and circulate them back to the boss so that everyone is on the same page. Then hold your boss, and yourself, to the agreement. Be realistic about what you can accomplish. There is always more you could do, so keep in mind that time to learn and plan before you enter a new job is a === Page 32 === precious commodity. Colleagues who have become subordinates may not want their relationships with you to change; this challenge is especially",

But change they must, and the sooner you accept that (and help others accept it, too), the better. Others in your organization will be looking for signs of favoritism and will judge you accordingly. If you have been promoted to supervise people who were once your peers, some may be disappointed competitors. Some may even work to undermine you. This kind of thing may subside with time. But expect early tests of your authority, and plan to meet them by being firm and fair. If you don’t establish limits early, you will live to regret it. Getting others to accept your move is an essential part of preparing yourself. So if you conclude that the people in question are never going to accept your new role and the resulting situation, then you must find a way to move them out of your organization as quickly as possible. Get Some Help Many organizations have programs and processes to help leaders make successful transitions. These range from high-potential development programs (which prepare promising leaders for senior levels) to formal onboarding processes (programs or coaching) that focus on key imperatives. You should take advantage of all the organization has to offer. However, even if your new organization doesn’t have formal transition support, you should engage with HR and your new boss about creating a 90-day transition plan. If you have been promoted, find out whether there are competency models describing the requirements of your new role (but don’t assume they tell the whole story). If you have been hired from the outside, ask for help in identifying and connecting with key stakeholders or finding a cultural interpreter. These people often are natural historians who can give you insight into how the organization has evolved and changed. Closing the Loop Preparing yourself for a new role turns out to be hard work, and some of the barriers may lie within you. Take a few minutes to think hard about your personal vulnerabilities in your new role, as revealed by your analysis of your problem preferences. How will you compensate for them? Then think about the external forces, such as commitments to your current boss, that could hold you back. How can you avoid that outcome? To borrow an old saw, preparing yourself is a journey and not a destination. You will have to work constantly to",

When Chris’s boss left to become vice president of operations at Phoenix Systems, a struggling software developer, he asked Chris to join him as head of the product quality and testing unit. Although it was a lateral move, Chris jumped at the opportunity to lead a turnaround. Dura was a world-class software development operation. Chris had joined the company right out of engineering school and had risen rapidly in the quality function. He was highly skilled; however, he had grown up in an environment with state-of-the-art technology and a motivated workforce. Having visited the Phoenix product testing group before taking the job, Chris knew that it did not come close to measuring up. He was determined to change that—and quickly. Soon after arriving, Chris declared Phoenix’s existing processes outdated and went on record as saying that the operation needed to be rebuilt from the",

Chris shared this information with his direct reports, saying that he planned to act quickly on the recommendations, starting with a reorganization of the product testing teams “the way we did things at Dura.” Only a month after the new structure was put in place, productivity in the unit plummeted, threatening to delay the launch of a key new product. Chris convened his direct reports and urged them to “get the problems fixed, and fast.” But the problems remained, and morale throughout the operation slumped. After only two months in his new role, Chris’s boss told him, “You’ve alienated just about everyone. I brought you here to improve quality, not tear it down.” His boss then peppered him with questions: “How much time did you spend learning about the operation? Did you know they’ve been asking for more investment for years? Have you seen what they were able to accomplish before you arrived with the resources they were given? You’ve got to stop doing and start listening.” Shaken, Chris held sobering discussions with his managers, supervisors, and groups of workers. He learned a lot about the creativity they had displayed in dealing with the lack of investment in the operation. He also got direct feedback about what was not working with his new structure. He called an all-hands meeting and announced that, based on the feedback he had received, there would be significant adjustments to the structure. He also committed to upgrading testing technology and training before making any other changes. What did Chris do wrong? Like many new leaders, he failed to focus on learning about his new === Page 35 === organization and so made some bad decisions that undercut his credibility. The first task in making a successful transition is to accelerate your learning. Effective learning gives you the foundational insights you need as you build your plan for the next 90 days. So it is essential to figure out what you need to know about your new organization and then to learn it as rapidly as you can. The more efficiently and effectively",

You can identify potential problems that might erupt and take you offtrack. The faster you climb the learning curve, the earlier you can begin to make good business decisions. Overcoming Learning Roadblocks When a new leader derails, failure to learn effectively is almost always a factor. Early in your transition you inevitably feel as if you are drinking from a fire hose. There is so much to absorb that it’s difficult to know where to focus. Amid the torrent of information coming your way, it’s easy to miss important signals. Or you might focus too much on the technical side of the business—products, customers, technologies, and strategies—and shortchange critical learning about culture and politics. To compound this problem, surprisingly few managers have received training in systematically diagnosing organizations. Those who have had such training invariably prove to be either human resource professionals or former management consultants. A related problem is a failure to plan to learn. Planning to learn means figuring out in advance what the important questions are and how you can best answer them. Few new leaders take the time to think systematically about their learning priorities. Fewer still explicitly create a learning plan when entering a new role. Some leaders even have “learning roadblocks,” internal barriers to learning. One example is Chris’s failure to focus on understanding the history of the organization. A baseline question you always should ask is, “How did we get to this point?” Otherwise, you risk tearing down existing structures or processes without knowing why they were put there in the first place. Armed with insight into the organization’s history, you may indeed decide that things need to change. Or you may find there is a good reason to leave it exactly where it is. A related learning block, as mentioned in the introduction, is the action imperative. The primary symptom is a nearly compulsive need to take action. Effective leaders strike the right balance between doing (making things happen) and being (observing and reflecting). But it is challenging, as Chris Hadley found, to let yourself “be” during transitions. And the pressure to “do” almost always comes more from inside the leader than from outside forces; it reflects a lack of confidence and a consequent need to prove yourself. Remember: simply displaying a genuine desire to learn and understand translates into",

So if you habitually find yourself too anxious or too busy to devote time to learning, you may suffer from the action imperative. It is a serious affliction, because often, being too busy to learn results in a death spiral. If, like Chris, you do not focus on learning, you can easily make poor early decisions that undermine your credibility, alienate potential supporters, and make people less likely to share important information with you. The result is that you make more bad decisions and enter a vicious cycle that can irreparably damage your credibility. So beware. It may feel right to enter a new === Page 36 === situation and begin acting decisively—and sometimes, as you will see in the next chapter, it is the right thing to do—but you risk being poorly prepared to see the real problems. Perhaps most destructive of all, some new leaders arrive, as Chris did at Phoenix, with “the” answer. They have already made up their minds about what the organization’s problems are and how to solve them. Having matured in organizations where things were done “the right way,” these leaders fail to realize that what works well in one organization may fail miserably in another. As Chris found out the hard way, coming in with the answer leaves you vulnerable to making serious mistakes and is likely to alienate people. Chris thought he could simply import what he had learned at Dura to fix the Phoenix plant’s problems. Leaders who are onboarding into new organizations must therefore focus on learning and adapting to the new culture. Otherwise they risk suffering the organizational equivalent of organ rejection syndrome (with the new leaders being the organs). They do things that trigger the organization’s immune system and find themselves under attack as a foreign body. Even in situations (such as turnarounds) when you have been brought in explicitly to import new ways of doing things, you still have to learn about the organization’s culture and politics to socialize and customize your approach. Managing Learning as an Investment Process If you approach your efforts to get up to speed as an investment process—and your scarce time and energy as resources that deserve careful management—you will realize returns in the form of actionable insights. An actionable insight is knowledge that enables you to make better decisions earlier and so helps you quickly reach the",

Chris would have acted differently if he had known that (1) senior management at Phoenix had systematically underinvested in the past, despite energetic efforts by local managers to upgrade, (2) the operation had achieved remarkable results in quality and productivity given what it had to work with, and (3) the supervisors and workforce were justifiably proud of what they had accomplished. To maximize your return on investment in learning, you must effectively and efficiently extract actionable insights from the mass of information available to you. Effective learning calls for figuring out what you need to learn so that you can focus your efforts. Devote some time to defining your learning agenda as early as possible, and return to it periodically to refine and supplement it. Efficient learning means identifying the best available sources of insight and then figuring out how to extract maximum insight with the least possible outlay of time. Chris’s approach to learning about the Phoenix operation was neither effective nor efficient. Defining Your Learning Agenda If Chris had it to do over, what might he have done? He would have planned to engage in a systematic learning process—creating a virtuous cycle of information gathering, analyzing, hypothesizing, and testing. The starting point is to begin to define your learning agenda, ideally before you formally enter the organization. A learning agenda crystallizes your learning priorities: what do you most need to learn? === Page 37 === It consists of a focused set of questions to guide your inquiry or the hypotheses you want to explore and test, or both. Of course, learning during a transition is iterative: at first, your learning agenda will consist mostly of questions, but as you learn more, you will hypothesize about what is going on and why. Increasingly, your learning will shift toward fleshing out and testing those hypotheses. How should you compile your early list of guiding questions? Start by generating questions about the past, the present, and the future (see boxes, “Questions About the Past,” “Questions About the Present,” and “Questions About the Future”). Why are things done the way they are? Are the reasons something was done (for example, to meet a competitive threat) still valid? Are conditions changing so that something different should be done in the future? The accompanying boxes offer sample questions in these three categories. Questions About the Past Performance How",

In the cultural domain, you must learn about norms, values, and behavioral expectations, which are almost certainly different from those in the organization you came from, even if you’re moving between units in the same company. In the political domain, you must understand the shadow organization —the informal set of processes and alliances that exist in the === Page 39 === shadow of the formal structure and strongly influence how work actually gets done. The political domain is both important and difficult to understand, because it isn’t easily visible to those who have not spent time in the organization and because political land mines can easily stymie your efforts to establish a solid base of support during the transition. Identifying the Best Sources of Insight You will learn from various types of hard data, such as financial and operating reports, strategic and functional plans, employee surveys, press accounts, and industry reports. But to make effective decisions, you also need “soft” information about the organization’s strategy, technical capabilities, culture, and politics. The only way to gain this intelligence is to talk to people who have critical knowledge about your situation. Who can provide the best return on your learning investment? Identifying promising sources will make your learning both comprehensive and efficient. Keep in mind that you need to listen to key people both inside and outside the organization (see figure 2-1 ). Talking to people with different points of view will deepen your insight. Specifically, it will help you translate between external realities and internal perceptions, and between people at the top of the hierarchy and people on the front lines. FIGURE 2-1 Sources of knowledge The most valuable external sources of information are likely to be the following: Customers . How do customers—external or internal—perceive your organization? How do your best customers assess your products or services? How about your customer service? If your customers are external, how do they rank your company against your competitors? === Page 40 === Suppliers . Suppliers can give you their perspectives on your organization in its role as a customer. You can also learn about the strengths and flaws of your internal systems for managing quality and customer satisfaction. Distributors . From distributors, you can learn about the logistics of product movement, customer service, and competitors’ practices and offerings. You can also get a sense of the distributors’ own capabilities.",

Analysts can give you a fairly objective assessment of your company’s strategy and capabilities as well as those of your competitors. Analysts also have a broad overview of the demands of the market and the economic health of the industry. Indispensable internal information sources are the following: Frontline R&D and operations . These are the people who develop and manufacture your products or deliver your services. Frontline people can familiarize you with the organization’s basic processes and its relationships with key external constituencies. They can also shed light on how the rest of the organization supports or undermines efforts on the front line. Sales and procurement . These people, along with customer service representatives and purchasing staff, interact directly with customers, distributors, and suppliers. Often they have up-to-date information about trends and imminent changes in the market. Staff . Talk with heads or key staff members of the finance, legal, and human resource functional areas. These people have specialized but useful perspectives on the internal workings of the organization. Integrators . Integrators are people who coordinate or facilitate cross-functional interaction, including project managers, plant managers, and product managers. You can learn from them how links within the company work and how the functions mesh. These people also can help you discover the true political hierarchies and identify where internal conflicts lie. Natural historians . Keep an eye out for “old-timers” or natural historians—people who have been with the organization for a long time and who naturally absorb its history. From these people, you can learn about the company’s mythology (key stories about how the organization came to be and trials it has gone through) and the roots of its culture and politics. If you are new to the organization, there often is much you can do to accelerate the onboarding process before you arrive. The starting point, beyond the recruiting process, is to leverage the rich array of resources available online, including background information and analysis of the organization, biographies of key people, and information available on the organization’s own website. Beyond that, it is highly desirable, if possible, to reach out to current or former employees to get a bead on the history and culture.

Many leaders tend to dive in and start talking to people. You will pick up much soft information in this way, but it is not efficient. That’s because it can be time-consuming and because its lack of structure makes it difficult to know how much weight to place on various individuals’ observations. Your views may be shaped excessively by the first few people (or last few) with whom you talk. And people may seek you out early precisely to influence you. Instead, you should consider using a structured learning process. To illustrate the advantages of this approach, imagine that you plan to meet with your direct reports to elicit their assessments. How might you go about doing this? Bringing them together right away might be a mistake, because some people will hesitate to reveal their views in a public forum. So you might start by meeting them one-on-one. Of course, this method has its drawbacks, too, because you have to meet people in some order. You should therefore expect that the people who are later on your schedule will talk to the earlier ones to try to get a sense of what you’re after. This may reduce your ability to gain a range of views and may allow others to interpret your messages in ways you might not intend. Suppose you decide to meet with your direct reports one-on-one. In what order will you meet with them? And how will you avoid being excessively influenced by what the first couple of people say? One approach is to keep to the same script in all your meetings. You might start with brief opening remarks about yourself and your approach, followed by questions about the other person (background, family, and interests) and then a standard set of questions about the business. This approach is powerful, because the responses you get are comparable. You can line them up side by side and analyze what is consistent and inconsistent about the responses. This comparison helps you gain insight into which people are being more or less open. When you are diagnosing a new organization, start by meeting with your direct reports one-on- one. (This is an example of taking a horizontal slice across an organization by interviewing people at the same level in different functions.) Ask them essentially the same five questions:",

Why is the organization facing (or going to face) these challenges? 3 . What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth? 4 . What would need to happen for the organization to exploit the potential of these opportunities? 5 . If you were me, what would you focus attention on? These five questions, coupled with careful listening and thoughtful follow-up, are certain to elicit many insights; think of what Chris might have learned by using this approach. By asking everyone the same set of questions, you can identify prevalent and divergent views and thus avoid being swayed by the first or most forceful or articulate person you talk to. How people answer can also tell you a lot about your new team and its politics. Who answers directly, and who is evasive or prone to tangents? === Page 42 === Who takes responsibility, and who points fingers? Who has a broad view of the business, and who seems stuck in a silo? Once you have distilled these early discussions into a set of observations, questions, and insights, convene your direct reports as a group, feed them back your impressions and questions, and invite discussion. You will learn about both substance and team dynamics and will simultaneously demonstrate how quickly you have begun to identify key issues. You need not follow this process rigidly. You could, for example, get an outside consultant to do some diagnosis of the organization and feed back the results to your group (see “Assimilating New Leaders”). Or you could invite an internal facilitator to run the process. The point is that even a modest structure—a script and a sequence of interactions, such as meeting with people individually, doing some analysis, and then meeting with them together—can dramatically accelerate your ability to extract actionable insights. Naturally, the questions you ask will be tailored for the groups you meet. If you’re meeting with salespeople, for example, consider asking, What do our customers want that they’re getting from our competitors and not getting from us? Assimilating New Leaders One example of a structured learning method is the new leader assimilation process originally developed by GE. In this process, each time a manager enters a significant new role, he is assigned a transition facilitator. The facilitator meets first with",

This is followed by a meeting with the leader’s new direct reports in which they are asked questions such as, What would you like to know about the new leader? What would you like him to know about you? About the business situation? The main findings are then fed back, without attribution, to the new leader. The process ends with a facilitated meeting between the new leader and the direct reports. Another example of a structured learning method is the use of a framework such as SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis to guide your diagnostic work. These sorts of frameworks also can be powerful tools for communicating with key stakeholders—bosses, peers, and direct reports—to help create shared views of the situation. Other structured learning methods are valuable in particular situations. Some of the methods described in table 2-1 may increase the efficiency of your learning process depending on your level in the organization and the business situation. Effective new leaders employ a combination of methods, tailoring their learning strategy to the demands of the situation. TABLE 2-1 Structured methods for learning === Page 43 === Creating a Learning Plan Your learning agenda defines what you want to learn. Your learning plan defines how you will go about learning it. It translates learning goals into specific sets of actions—identifying promising sources of insight and using systematic methods—that accelerate your learning. Your learning plan is a critical part of your overall 90-day plan. In fact, as you will discover later, learning should be a primary focus of your plan for your first 30 days on the job (unless, of course, there is a disaster in progress). The heart of your learning plan is a cyclical learning process in which you collect information, analyze and distill it, and develop and test hypotheses, thus progressively deepening your understanding of your new organization. Obviously, the specific insights you decide to pursue will vary from situation to situation. You can begin by working with the learning plan template shown here (see box, “Learning Plan Template”). In chapter 3 , you will explore various types of transition situations and return to the subject of what you need to learn and when.

They can fill you in on the history, culture, and politics of the organization, and they are also potential allies and influencers. Update your questions and hypotheses. Meet with your boss again to discuss your observations. Getting Help The primary responsibility for accelerating your learning rests on you, the leader. However, there are many other players whose support can make the learning process a lot less painful. There is much that bosses, peers, and even direct reports can do to accelerate your learning. However, to enlist their aid === Page 45 === you need to be clear about what you’re trying to do and how they can help. Critically, you need to be willing to ask in the first place and not feel that you should know everything and be in complete control from the moment you walk through the door. Support for learning is particularly important for leaders joining new organizations. This is true whether you have been hired from the outside (onboarding) or making a move between units in the same organization (inboarding, which, as discussed earlier, is roughly 70 percent as difficult as being hired from the outside). In both cases, you likely will enter a different culture and will lack the political wiring you had in your previous role. If your new organization has an effective onboarding system, it should help you understand the culture and speed the process of identifying and connecting with key stakeholders. If it doesn’t, ask for this type of help. Closing the Loop Your learning priorities and strategies will inevitably shift as you dig deeper. As you start to interact with your new boss, figure out where to get some early wins, or build supportive coalitions, it will be critical for you to gain additional insights. So plan to return to this chapter periodically to reassess your learning agenda and create new learning plans. ACCELERATE YOUR LEARNING—CHECKLIST 1 . How effective are you at learning about new organizations? Do you sometimes fall prey to the action imperative? To coming in with “the” answer? If so, how will you avoid doing this? 2 .

In fact, he’d recently overseen a quick and successful turnaround of European manufacturing operations at Global Foods, a multinational consumer products company. He was less sure, however, that the same sort of approach would be effective in his new role at the firm. A hard-driving, German-born executive, Karl had acted decisively in Europe to restructure an organization that was broken because of the company’s overemphasis on growth through acquisition and its focus on country-level operations to the exclusion of other opportunities. Within a year, Karl had centralized the most important manufacturing support functions, closed four of the least efficient plants, and shifted a big chunk of production to Eastern Europe. These changes, painful though they were, began to bear fruit by the end of eighteen months, and operational efficiency improved dramatically. But no good deed goes unpunished. Karl’s success in Europe led to his appointment as the executive vice president of supply chain for the company’s core North American operations, headquartered in New Jersey. The job was much bigger than the earlier one, combining manufacturing with strategic sourcing, outbound logistics, and customer service. In contrast to the situation in Europe, North American operations were not in immediate crisis— something Karl recognized was the essence of the problem. The organization’s long-term success had only recently shown signs of slipping. The preceding year, industry benchmarks had placed the company’s manufacturing performance slightly below average in overall efficiency, and in the lower one-third in the crucial area of customer satisfaction with on-time delivery. Mediocre scores, to be sure, but nothing that screamed “turnaround.” Meanwhile, Karl’s own assessment indicated that serious problems were brewing. The business was addicted to fighting fires; managers reveled in their",

Karl believed it was only a matter of time before major failures occurred. Furthermore, executives relied too much on gut feelings to make critical decisions, and information systems provided too little of the right kind of objective data. These shortcomings contributed, in Karl’s view, to widespread, unfounded optimism about the organization’s future. To take charge successfully, you must have a clear understanding of the situation you are facing and the implications for what you need to do and how you need to do it. From the outset, leaders like Karl need to focus on answering two fundamental questions. The first question is, What kind of change am I being called upon to lead? Only by answering this question will you know how to match your strategy to the situation. The second question is, What kind of change leader am I? Here the answer has implications for how you should adjust your leadership style. Careful diagnosis of the === Page 47 === business situation will clarify the challenges, opportunities, and resources available to you. Using the STARS Model STARS is an acronym for five common business situations leaders may find themselves moving into: start-up, turnaround, accelerated growth, realignment, and sustaining success. The STARS model outlines the characteristics and challenges of, respectively, launching a venture; getting one back on track; dealing with rapid expansion; reenergizing a once-leading business that’s now facing serious problems; and inheriting an organization that is performing well and then taking it to the next level. In all five of the STARS situations, the eventual goal is the same: a successful and growing business. However, the challenges and opportunities, summarized in table 3-1 , vary in predictable ways depending on which situation you are experiencing. What are the defining features of the five STARS situations? In a start-up , you are charged with assembling the capabilities (people, funding, and technology) to get a new business, product, project, or relationship off the ground. This means you can shape the organization from the outset by recruiting your team, playing a major role in defining the agenda, and building the architecture of the business. Participants in a start-up are likely to be more excited and hopeful than members of a troubled group facing failure. But at the same time, employees of a start-up are typically much less focused",

TABLE 3-1 The STARS model In a turnaround , you take on a unit or group that is recognized to be in deep trouble and work to get it back on track. A turnaround is the classic burning platform, demanding rapid, decisive action. Most people understand that substantial change is necessary, although they may be in disarray and in significant disagreement about what needs to be done. Turnarounds are ready-fire-aim situations: you === Page 48 === need to make the tough calls with less than full knowledge and then adjust as you learn more. In contrast, realignments (and sustaining-success assignments) are more ready-aim-fire situations. Turning around a failing business requires the new leader to cut it down to a defensible core fast and then begin to build it back up. This painful process, if successful, leaves the business in a sustaining- success situation. If efforts to turn around the business fail, the result often is shutdown or divestiture. In an accelerated-growth situation , the organization has begun to hit its stride, and the hard work of scaling up has begun. This typically means you’re putting in the structures, processes, and systems necessary to rapidly expand the business (or project, product, or relationship). You also likely need to hire and onboard a lot of people while making sure they become part of the culture that has made the organization successful thus far. The risks, of course, lie in expanding too much too fast. Start-ups, turnarounds, and accelerated-growth situations involve much resource-intensive construction work; there isn’t much existing infrastructure and capacity for you to build on. To a significant degree, you get to start fresh or, in the case of accelerated growth, to build on a strong foundation. In realignments and sustaining-success situations, in contrast, you enter organizations that have significant strengths but also serious constraints on what you can and cannot do. Fortunately, in these two situations you typically have some time before you need to make major calls. This is good, because you must learn a lot about the culture and politics and begin building supportive coalitions. Because of internal complacency, erosion of key capabilities, or external challenges, successful businesses tend to drift toward trouble. In a realignment, your challenge is to revitalize a unit,",

The clouds are gathering on the horizon, but the storm has not yet broken—and many people may not even see the clouds. The biggest challenge often is to create a sense of urgency. There may be a lot of denial; the leader needs to open people’s eyes to the fact that a problem actually exists. This was the situation facing Karl in North America. Here, the good news is that the organization likely has at least islands of significant strength (good products, customer relationships, processes, and people). In a sustaining-success situation, you are shouldering responsibility for preserving the vitality of a successful organization and taking it to the next level. This emphatically does not mean that the organization can rest on its laurels. Rather, it means you need to understand, at a deep level, what has made the business successful and position it to meet the inevitable challenges so that it will continue to grow and prosper. In fact, the key to sustaining success often lies in continuously starting up, accelerating, and realigning parts of the business. A key implication is that success in transitioning depends, in no small measure, on your ability to transform the prevailing organizational psychology in predictable ways. In start-ups, the prevailing mood is often one of excited confusion, and your job is to channel that energy into productive directions, in part by deciding what not to do. In turnarounds, you may be dealing with a group of people who are close to despair; it is your job to provide them with a concrete plan for moving forward and confidence that it will improve the situation. In accelerated-growth situations, you need to help people understand that the organization needs to be more disciplined and get them to work within defined processes and systems. In realignments, you will likely have to pierce the veil of denial that is preventing people from confronting the need to reinvent the business. Finally, in sustaining-success situations, you must invent the challenge by finding ways to keep people motivated, combat complacency, and find new direction for growth—both organizational and personal. === Page 49 === You cannot figure out where to take a new organization if you do not understand where it has been and how it got where it is.

To understand your situation, you must put on your historian’s hat. But if you’re not leading a large business, can you still use the STARS model to understand the challenges you face? Absolutely. You can apply it regardless of your level in the organization. You may be a new CEO taking over an entire company that is in start-up mode. Or you could be a first-line supervisor managing a new production line, a brand manager launching a new product, an R&D team leader responsible for a new product development project, or an information technology manager responsible for implementing a new enterprise software system. All of these situations share the characteristics of a start-up. Similarly, turnaround, accelerated growth, realignment, and sustaining success arise at all levels, in companies large and small. Diagnosing Your STARS Portfolio In reality, you’re unlikely to encounter a pure and tidy example of a start-up, turnaround, accelerated- growth, realignment, or sustaining-success situation. At a high level your situation may fit reasonably neatly into one of these categories. But as soon as you drill down, you will almost certainly discover that you’re managing a portfolio—of products, projects, processes, plants, or people—that represents a mix of STARS situations. For instance, you may be taking over an organization that enjoys incremental growth with successful products and in which one group is launching a line of products based on a new technology. Or you may be working to turn around a company that has a couple of high-performing, state-of-the-art plants. The next step in applying the STARS model is to diagnose your STARS portfolio; you must figure out which parts of your new organization belong in each of the five categories. Take time to assign the pieces of your new responsibilities (such as products, processes, projects, plants, and people) to the five categories using table 3-2 . Given this arrangement, how will you manage the various pieces differently? This exercise will help you to think systematically about challenges and opportunities in each piece. It will also supply you a common language with which to talk to your new boss, peers, and direct reports about what you are going to do and why. Leading Change There is no one-size-fits-all approach to leading change. This is why it’s important to be clear about the STARS mix. Using the STARS",

If Karl had treated his new situation as a turnaround and tried to conduct radical surgery, he probably would have incurred both active and passive resistance, undermining his ability to realize needed change, especially because he was an outsider and therefore vulnerable to being isolated and undercut. Recognizing what was required in === Page 50 === North American operations, Karl adopted a more measured approach. TABLE 3-2 Diagnosing your STARS portfolio Use the table to identify the mix of STARS situations you face. First, identify which elements (projects, processes, products, perhaps even complete businesses) in your new responsibilities fall into the various STARS situations in the first column; list those elements in the second column. You need not have something in every category. Everything may be in turnaround, or it may be a mix of two or three types. Then use the third column to estimate the percentage of your effort that should be allocated to each category in the next 90 days, making sure it adds up to 100%. Finally, think about which of these situations you most prefer to do. If you also assigned that situation the highest priority, be sure that your preferences are not overly influencing your priorities. Armed with insight into your STARS portfolio and the key challenges and opportunities, you will adopt the right strategies for leading change. Doing so means, however, adopting the approaches laid out in this book for creating momentum in your next 90 days. Specifically, you must establish priorities, define strategic intent, identify where you can secure early wins, build the right leadership team, and create supporting alliances. Let’s look at what Karl did differently in the turnaround and realignment situations he faced. The starting point, of course, was focused learning. In the turnaround situation in Europe, Karl needed to rapidly assess the organization’s technical dimensions—strategy, competitors, products, markets, and technologies—much as a consultant would. In his new leadership role in North America, Karl’s learning challenge was markedly different. Technical comprehension was still important, obviously, but cultural",

That’s because internal social dynamics often cause successful organizations to drift into trouble, and because getting people to acknowledge the need for change is much more a political challenge than a technical one. Particularly for a newcomer to the organization, as Karl was, a deep understanding of the culture and politics is a prerequisite for leadership success—and even survival. Likewise, as Karl worked to establish priorities, he had to weigh the demands of the situation. The European turnaround required radical surgery. The strategy and organizational structure of the business were preventing it from achieving its goals and had to be changed quickly. So Karl closed plants, shifted production, and cut the workforce dramatically. He also rapidly centralized important manufacturing functions in order to reduce fragmentation and cut costs. The North American === Page 51 === realignment, in contrast, didn’t call for an immediate transformation of strategy or structure. There weren’t any major capacity or productivity problems, so plant closures weren’t necessary. The manufacturing functions were already centralized and strong. The real problems lay in systems, skills, and culture. It therefore made sense for Karl to focus on those areas. Situational factors also played a large role in how Karl built his leadership teams in the two situations. To expeditiously turn around the European business, Karl cleaned house at the top of the organization and recruited most of the new senior talent from the outside. In North America, however, the leadership team he inherited was already quite strong. Still, he realized he needed to make a few high-payoff changes in the roster. A couple of central manufacturing roles required leaders with stronger technical skills to support the systems changes he planned to make, and there was an influential manager who, despite Karl’s best efforts, didn’t grasp the need for change; in fact, the manager’s inaction threatened to undermine Karl’s leadership. That person’s departure sent a crucial message to the rest of the organization. Meanwhile, Karl promoted from within to fill that role and others, and that helped rally the organization behind his plans. People came to see that he wasn’t only focusing on the weaknesses of the business but was also appreciative of its strengths. Finally, Karl had the good judgment to secure early wins differently in the two situations. In turnarounds, leaders must move people out of a state of despair. Karl did that in",

In the realignment, in contrast, Karl’s most important early win was to raise people’s awareness of the need for change. He accomplished that by putting more emphasis on facts and figures; he revamped the company’s performance metrics in manufacturing and customer service to focus employees’ attention on critical weaknesses in those areas, and he also introduced external benchmarks and hard-nosed assessments by respected consultants—drawing on impartial voices from outside the company to help make his case. These actions enabled him to pierce the unfounded optimism and send an important message to the rest of the organization. Key differences between leading change in turnaround and realignment situations are summarized in table 3-3 . TABLE 3-3 Leading change in turnarounds versus realignments === Page 52 === Managing Yourself The STARS state of your organization also has implications for the adjustments you’ll need to make to manage yourself. This is particularly true when it comes to determining leadership styles and figuring out whether you are reflexively a “hero” or a “steward.” In turnarounds, leaders are often dealing with people who are hungry for hope, vision, and direction, and that necessitates a heroic style of leadership—charging against the enemy, sword in hand. People line up behind the hero in times of trouble and follow commands. The premium is on rapid diagnosis of the business situation (markets, technologies, products, strategies) and then aggressive moves to cut back the organization to a defensible core. You need to act quickly and decisively, often on the basis of incomplete information. Clearly, this was the case for Karl in Europe. He immediately took charge, diagnosed the situation, set direction, and made painful calls. Because the outlook was bleak, people were willing to act on his directives without offering much resistance. Realignments, in contrast, demand from leaders something more akin to stewardship or servant === Page 53 === leadership—a more diplomatic and less ego-driven approach that entails building consensus for the need for change. More subtle influence skills come into play; skilled stewards have deep understandings of the culture and politics of their organizations. Stewards are more patient and systematic than heroes in deciding which people, processes, and other resources to preserve and which to discard. They also painstakingly cultivate awareness of the need for change",

In his North America appointment, Karl needed to learn to temper some of his heroic tendencies; he had to make careful assessments, move deliberately toward change, and lay a foundation for sustainable success. Whether any leader in transition can adapt her personal leadership strategy successfully depends greatly on the ability to embrace the following pillars of self-management: enhancing self-awareness, exercising personal discipline, and building complementary teams. Because of their differing imperatives, it is easy for heroes to stumble in realignment and sustaining-success situations and for stewards to struggle in start-ups and turnarounds. The experienced turnaround person facing a realignment is at risk of moving too fast, needlessly causing resistance. The experienced realignment person in a turnaround situation is at risk of moving too slowly and expending energy on cultivating consensus when it is unnecessary to do so, thus squandering precious time. This is not to say that people who are natural heroes cannot get in touch with their inner stewards and vice versa. Good leaders can succeed in all five of the STARS situations, although no one is equally good at all of them. It is essential to make a hardheaded assessment of which of your skills and inclinations will serve you well in your particular situation and which are likely to get you into trouble. Don’t arrive ready for war if what you need is to build alliances. You also need to remember that leadership is a team sport. Your STARS portfolio has implications for the precise mix of heroes and stewards (every organization needs both) on your leadership team. Karl willed himself toward stewardship in North America, but he knew he more naturally and effectively played the hero role. The implications of this bit of self-awareness were threefold. First, he needed to stock his team with some natural stewards to whom he could turn for wise counsel (lest he go off half-cocked) and to whom he could delegate some of the necessary outreach. Second, he had to identify where it actually made sense to focus some of his heroic energies. After all, every organization, even the most successful, has parts that are in serious trouble. As long as he didn’t start setting fires just to fight them and didn’t jeopardize the larger goal of realigning the business, this was an appropriate way to achieve a balance. Third, Karl",

Rewarding Success The STARS framework has implications for how you should evaluate the people who work for you, and for the culture you want to create. Data from the Harvard Business Review Transition Survey helps illustrate this essential point. Participants were asked which of the STARS situations they thought were most challenging and in which they would most prefer to be. The results, summarized in table 3-4 , are illuminating. The most challenging situation was assessed to be realignment, followed === Page 54 === by sustaining success and turnaround. Start-up and accelerated growth were assessed as being significantly easier. However, when it came to preferences, the pattern reversed, with start-up being (by far) the most popular, followed by turnaround and accelerated growth. This is not a surprising finding, and the underlying reasons are revealing. It is not the case that people are drawn to the easy situations. Rather, they are drawn to situations that are (1) more fun and (2) get more recognition. A successful start-up is a visible and easily measurable individual accomplishment, as is a successful turnaround. In a realignment, in contrast, success consists of avoiding disaster. It is hard to measure results in a realignment when success means that nothing much happens; it’s the dog that doesn’t bark. Also, success in realignment requires painstakingly building awareness of the need for change, and that often means giving credit to the group rather than taking it yourself. As for rewarding sustaining success, people seldom call their local power company to say, “Thanks for keeping the lights on today.” But if the power goes off, the screaming is immediate and loud. TABLE 3-4 STARS challenges and preferences Survey respondents were asked to identify which STARS situation they thought was the most challenging and which they most preferred (i.e., would choose if they could). The differences in their assessments are striking, particularly when the sums of the numbers for more action-oriented, authority-driven STARS situations (start-up, turnaround, and accelerated growth) are compared to those that call for more focus on learning, reflection, and influence (realignment and sustaining success) .

Few high-potential leaders show much interest in realignments, preferring the action and recognition associated with turnarounds (and start-ups). So who exactly is responsible for preventing businesses from becoming turnarounds? And does the fact that companies reward turnarounds (and do not know how to reward realignments) make it more likely that businesses will end in crisis? Skilled managers can seemingly count on less-accomplished === Page 55 === people to mess up businesses so that they can come charging to the rescue. The more general point, of course, is that performance must be evaluated and rewarded differently in the different STARS situations. The performance of people put in charge of start-ups and turnarounds is easiest to evaluate, because you can focus on measurable outcomes relative to a clear prior baseline. Evaluating success and failure in realignment and sustaining-success situations is much more problematic. Performance in a realignment may be better than expected, but still poor. Or it may be that nothing much seems to happen, because a crisis was avoided. Sustaining-success situations pose similar problems. Success may consist of a small loss of market share in the face of a concerted attack by competitors or the eking out of a few percentage points of top-line growth in a mature business. The unknown in both realignments and sustaining-success situations is what would have happened if other actions had been taken or other people had been in charge—the “as compared to what?” problem. Measuring success in such situations takes much more work, because to assess the adequacy of their responses, you must have a deep understanding of the challenges new leaders face and the actions they are taking. Closing the Loop Your understanding of the mix of STARS situations inevitably will deepen and shift as you learn more about your new organization.

Both told him the same thing: “Start updating your résumé. Cates is going to eat you alive.” His new boss, Vaughan Cates, was a hard-driving business unit leader with a reputation for getting results—and for being tough on people. She had recently taken over the unit, and several of the people she had inherited had already left. Michael’s friends anticipated the problem. “You’ve had a lot of success,” one said. “But Cates will think you’re not aggressive enough. You’re a planner and team builder. She’ll think you’re too slow and not up to the tough decisions.” Forewarned, Michael laid the groundwork with Vaughan to gain time for diagnosis and planning. “I want to operate on a 90-day time frame, starting with 30 days to get on top of things,” he told her. “Then I will bring you a detailed assessment and plan with goals and actions for the next 60 days.” Michael updated her regularly on his progress. Pressed by her to make a call on a major systems purchase after three weeks, Michael held firm to his schedule. At the end of 30 days, he delivered a strong plan that pleased his new boss. A month later, Michael returned to report some early wins and to ask Vaughan for more head count to advance a key project. She subjected him to withering questioning, but he was on top of his business case. Eventually she agreed to his requests but set strict",

Armed with what he needed, Michael was soon able to report that he had met several interim targets. Building on his momentum, Michael raised the question of style at their next meeting: “We have different styles, but I can deliver for you,” he said. “I want you to judge me on my results, not on how I get them.” It took nearly a year, but Michael built a solid, productive working relationship with Vaughan. To succeed as Michael did with a new boss, it’s wise to negotiate success. It’s well worth investing time in this critical relationship up front, because your new boss sets your benchmarks, interprets your actions for other key players, and controls access to resources you need. He will have more impact than any other individual on how quickly you reach the break-even point, and on your eventual success or failure. Negotiating success means proactively engaging with your new boss to shape the game so that you have a fighting chance of achieving desired goals. Many new leaders just play the game, reactively taking their situation as given—and failing as a result. The alternative is to shape the game by negotiating with your boss to establish realistic expectations, reach consensus, and secure sufficient resources. By negotiating effectively with Vaughan, Michael laid the foundation for his === Page 57 === success. Keep in mind that the nature of your relationship with your new boss should depend on your level in the organization and the business situation you face. The higher you rise, the more autonomy you’re likely to have. This is especially the case if you and your boss are situated in different locations. Lack of oversight can be a blessing if you get what you need to succeed. Or it can be a curse if you get enough rope to hang yourself. What you need from a boss also varies among the STARS business situations. In start-ups, you need resources and perhaps protection from higher-level interference. In turnarounds, you may need to be pushed to cut back the business quickly to the defensible core. When you’re accelerating growth, the key may be securing appropriate levels of investment. If you’re in a realignment, you may need your boss to help you make the case for change. In a sustaining-success situation, you may need help to learn about the business and avoid early mistakes that",

There is much you can do to build a productive working relationship with your new boss, and you should start doing it as soon as you’re being considered for a new role. Keep it in mind as you participate in interviews, get selected, and formally begin the new job. This chapter shows you how to engage in the right kinds of dialogue with your new boss. Read it even if you will be reporting to the same boss in your new role. Your relationship likely won’t stay the same. The boss’s expectations may be different, and you may need more resources. Many managers mistakenly assume that they can continue to work with a current boss in the same way despite being in a different role. Don’t make this error. Think also about how you might use the ideas in this chapter to accelerate relationship building with your own new direct reports. After all, don’t you have a big stake in getting them to the break- even point as quickly as possible? Focusing on the Fundamentals How do you build a productive relationship with a new boss? There are some basic do’s and don’ts. Let’s start with the don’ts. Don’t stay away. If you have a boss who doesn’t reach out to you, or with whom you have uncomfortable interactions, you will have to reach out yourself. Otherwise, you risk potentially crippling communication gaps. It may feel good to be given a lot of rope, but resist the urge to take it. Get on your boss’s calendar regularly. Be sure your boss is aware of the issues you face and that you are aware of her expectations, especially whether and how they’re shifting. Don’t surprise your boss. It’s no fun bringing your boss bad news. However, most bosses consider it a far greater sin not to report emerging problems early enough. Worst of all is for your boss to learn about a problem from someone else. It’s usually best to give your new boss at least a heads-up as soon as you become aware of a developing problem. Don’t approach your boss only with problems. That said, you don’t want to be perceived as bringing nothing but problems for your boss to solve. You also need to have plans for how === Page 58 === you will proceed. This emphatically does not mean that you must fashion",

The key here is to give some thought to how to address the problem—even if it is only gathering more information—and to your role and the help you will need. (This is a good thing to keep in mind in dealing with direct reports, too. It can be dangerous to say, “Don’t bring me problems, bring me solutions.” Far better is, “Don’t just bring me problems, bring me plans for how we can begin to address them.”) Don’t run down your checklist. There is a tendency, even for senior leaders, to use meetings with a boss as an opportunity to run through your checklist of what you’ve been doing. Sometimes this is appropriate, but it is rarely what your boss needs or wants to hear. You should assume she wants to focus on the most important things you’re trying to do and how she can help. Don’t go in without at most three things you really need to share or on which you need action. Don’t expect your boss to change. You and your new boss may have very different working styles. You may communicate in different ways, motivate in different ways, and prefer different levels of detail in overseeing your direct reports. But it’s your responsibility to adapt to your boss’s style; you need to adapt your approach to work with your boss’s preferences. There are some fundamental do’s as well. Following them will make your life easier. Clarify expectations early and often. Begin managing expectations from the moment you consider taking a new role. Focus on expectations during the interview process. You are in trouble if your boss expects you to fix things fast when you know the business has serious structural problems. It’s wise to get bad news on the table early and to lower unrealistic expectations. Then check in regularly to make sure your boss’s expectations have not shifted. Revisiting expectations is especially important if you’re onboarding from the outside and don’t have a deep understanding of the culture and politics. Take 100 percent responsibility for making the relationship work. This is the flip side of “Don’t stay away.” Don’t expect your boss to reach out or to offer you the time and support you need. It’s best to begin by assuming that",

Negotiate time lines for diagnosis and action planning. Don’t let yourself get caught up immediately in firefighting or be pressured to make calls before you’re ready. Buy yourself some time, even if it’s only a few weeks, to diagnose the new organization and come up with an action plan. It worked for Michael in his dealings with Vaughan, and it can work for you. The 90- day plan discussed at the end of this chapter is an excellent vehicle. Aim for early wins in areas important to the boss. Whatever your own priorities, figure out what your boss cares about most. What are his priorities and goals, and how do your actions fit into this picture? Once you know, aim for early results in those areas. One good way is to focus on three things that are important to your boss and discuss what you’re doing about them every time you interact. In that way, your boss will feel ownership of your success. === Page 59 === Pursue good marks from those whose opinions your boss respects. Your new boss’s opinion of you will be based in part on direct interactions and in part on what she hears about you from trusted others. Your boss will have preexisting relationships with people who are now your peers and possibly your subordinates. You needn’t curry favor with the people your boss trusts. Simply be alert to the multiple channels through which information and opinion about you will reach your boss. With these basic rules in mind, you can begin to plan how to engage with your new boss. Planning for Five Conversations Your relationship with your new boss will be built through an ongoing dialogue. Your discussions will begin before you accept the new position and continue into your transition and beyond. Several fundamental subjects belong at the center of this dialogue. In fact, it’s valuable to include plans for five specific conversations with your new boss about transition-related subjects in your 90-day plan. These are not subjects to be dealt with in separate meetings but are intertwined threads of dialogue. 1 . The situational diagnosis conversation. In this conversation, you seek to understand how your new boss sees the STARS portfolio you have inherited. Are there elements of start-up, turnaround,",

What factors—both soft and hard—make this situation a challenge? What resources within the organization can you draw on? Your view may differ from your boss’s, but it is essential to grasp how she sees the situation. 2 . The expectations conversation. Your goal in this conversation is to understand and negotiate expectations. What does your new boss need you to do in the short term and in the medium term? What will constitute success? Critically, how will your performance be measured? When? You might conclude that your boss’s expectations are unrealistic and that you need to work to reset them. Also, as part of your broader campaign to secure early wins, discussed in the next chapter, keep in mind that it’s better to underpromise and overdeliver. 3 . The resource conversation. This conversation is essentially a negotiation for critical resources. What do you need to be successful? What do you need your boss to do? The resources need not be limited to funding or personnel. In a realignment, for example, you may need help from your boss to persuade the organization to confront the need for change. Key here is to focus your boss on the benefits and costs of what you can accomplish with different amounts of resources. 4 . The style conversation. This conversation is about how you and your new boss can best interact on an ongoing basis. What forms of communication does he prefer, and for what? Face-to-face? Voice, electronic? How often? What kinds of decisions does he want to be consulted on, and when can you make the call on your own? How do your styles differ, and what are the implications for the ways you should interact? 5 . The personal development conversation. Once you’re a few months into your new role, you can === Page 60 === begin to discuss how you’re doing and what your developmental priorities should be. Where are you doing well? In what areas do you need to improve or do things differently? Are there projects or special assignments you could undertake (without sacrificing focus)? In practice, your dialogue about these subjects will overlap and evolve over time. You might address several of the five issues in a single meeting, or you might work out issues related to one subject through a series of brief exchanges.",

However, there is logic to the sequence just described. Your early conversations should focus on situational diagnosis, expectations, and style. As you learn more, you will be ready to negotiate for resources, revisiting your diagnosis of the situation and resetting expectations as necessary. When you feel the relationship is reasonably well established, you can introduce the personal development conversation. Take time to plan for each conversation, and signal clearly to your boss what you hope to accomplish in each exchange. Use table 4-1 to take stock of where you currently stand in having each of these conversations and what your priorities are for the next 30 days. If you’re in the process of interviewing for a new role, use it to capture what you’ve learned and identify focal points for conversation. TABLE 4-1 The five conversations Now use the detailed guidelines that follow to plan the next steps for each of the five conversations with your new boss. Planning the Situation Conversation Reaching a shared understanding of the business situation you face, and of its associated challenges === Page 61 === and opportunities, is your goal in the situational diagnosis conversation. This shared understanding is the foundation for everything you will do. If you and your boss do not define your new situation in the same way, you will not receive the support you need. Thus, your first discussion should center on clearly defining your new situation using the STARS model as a shared language. (The same is true, as I discuss later, with your team.) Match Your Support to Your Situation The support you need from your boss will depend on your STARS portfolio—start-up, turnaround, accelerated growth, realignment, sustaining success, or some mix. Once you reach a common understanding of the situation, think carefully about the role you need your new boss to play and the kinds of support you will ask for. In all five situations, you need your boss to give you the direction, support, and space to do your job. Table 4-2 lists typical roles your boss might play in each of the STARS situations.

Critically, you need to agree on how your boss will measure progress. What will constitute success, for your boss and for you? When does your boss expect to see results? How will you measure success? Over what time frame? If you succeed, what is next? If you don’t manage expectations, they will manage you. Match Expectations to the Situation Closely align your expectations with your shared assessment of the situation. In a turnaround situation, for example, you and your boss would probably agree on the need to take decisive action quickly. You would both have explicit expectations for the immediate future, such as making difficult decisions to reduce costs in nonessential areas or concentrating on the products with the highest margins. In this scenario, you would probably measure success by improvements in the business’s overall financial performance. Aim for Early Wins in Areas Important to Your Boss Whatever your own priorities, pinpoint what your boss cares about most, and aim for early wins in those areas. If you want to succeed, you need your boss’s help; in turn, you should help her succeed. When you pay attention to your boss’s priorities, she will feel ownership in your success. The most effective approach is to integrate your boss’s goals with your own efforts to get early wins. If this is impossible, look for early wins based solely on your boss’s priorities. Identify the Untouchables If there are parts of the organization—products, facilities, people—about which your new boss is proprietary, it is essential to identify them as soon as possible. You don’t want to find out that you’re pressing to shut down the product line your boss started up or to replace someone who has been his loyal ally. So try to deduce what your boss is sensitive about. You can do this by understanding your boss’s personal history, by talking to others, and by paying close attention to facial expression, tone, and body language. If you’re uncertain, float an idea gently as a trial balloon, and then watch his reactions closely. Educate Your Boss One of your immediate tasks is to shape your boss’s perceptions of what you can and should achieve. You may find her expectations unrealistic, or simply at odds with your own beliefs about what needs to be",

In a realignment, for example, your boss might attribute the worst problems to a certain part of the business, whereas you believe they lie elsewhere. In this case, you would need to educate your boss about the underlying problems to reset expectations. Proceed carefully—especially if your boss feels invested in the way things have always been or is responsible in part for the problems. Underpromise and Overdeliver Whether you and your boss agree on expectations, try to bias yourself somewhat toward === Page 63 === underpromising achievements and overdelivering results. This strategy contributes to building credibility. Consider how your organization’s capacity for change might affect your ability to deliver on the promises you make. Be conservative in what you promise. If you deliver more, you will delight your boss. But if you promise too much and fail to deliver, you risk undermining your credibility. Even if you accomplish a great deal, you will have failed in the boss’s eyes. Clarify, Clarify, Clarify Even if you’re sure you know what your boss expects, you should go back regularly to confirm and clarify. Some bosses know what they want but are not good at expressing it. You don’t want to achieve clarity only after you have headed down the wrong road. So you must be prepared to keep asking questions until you’re sure you understand. Try, for example, asking the same questions in different ways to gain more insight. Work at reading between the lines accurately and developing good hypotheses about what your boss is likely to want. Try to put yourself in his shoes and understand how his boss will evaluate him. Figure out how you fit into the larger picture. Above all, don’t let key issues remain ambiguous. Ambiguity about goals and expectations is dangerous. A tie in a conflict over what was said about expectations in an earlier conversation doesn’t go to you. It goes to your boss. Planning the Resource Conversation The resource conversation is an ongoing negotiation with your new boss for critical resources. Before you launch this conversation, you must have agreement with your boss on your STARS portfolio and associated goals and expectations. Now you must secure the resources you need to meet those expectations. The resources you need will depend on the situations you’re dealing with. In start-up situations, your most urgent",

In turnaround situations, you need authority, backed by political support, to make the tough decisions and secure scarce financial and human resources. In accelerated-growth situations, you need the investment necessary to support growth, as well as support for putting in place needed systems and structures. In realignment situations, you need consistent, public backing to get the organization to confront the need for change. Ideally, your boss will stand shoulder to shoulder with you, helping pierce through denial and complacency. In sustaining-success situations, you require financial and technical resources to sustain the core business and exploit promising new opportunities. You also need periodic pushes to set stretch goals that will keep you from drifting into complacency. The first step is to decide what resources—tangible and intangible—you must have to succeed. === Page 64 === Identify the resources already available to you, such as experienced people or new products ready to be launched. Then identify the resources you will need help in obtaining. Ask yourself, “What exactly do I need from my boss?” The sooner you can articulate the resources you need, the sooner you can broach these requests. It’s best to put as much as possible on the table as early as possible. Try using the menu approach: lay out the costs and benefits of different levels of resource commitment. “If you want my sales to grow seven percent next year, I need investment of X dollars. If you want ten percent growth, I will need Y dollars.” Going back for more too often is a sure way to lose credibility. If it takes more time to get a handle on the resources you need to achieve specific goals, then so be it. Michael negotiated for the necessary time—a critical resource—to avoid this problem. Play or Change the Game? You may be able to achieve your goals by playing the game according to the prevailing rules. If you can maneuver within the accepted cultural and political norms, your resource requests will be expected—and you will find it easier to get what you need. In other situations—notably realignments and turnarounds—you may need to change or even abandon established ways of doing business. Your resource requests will probably be more sweeping, and failure to secure them more damaging. You will have to negotiate harder to get what",

These circumstances call for being clear about how the situation, expectations, and resources must line up to give you a reasonable shot at success. Clarify your needs in your own mind before you enter these discussions, back them up with as much hard data as you can get, and prepare to explain exactly why you see certain resources as essential. Then stick to your guns. Keep coming back. Enlist others to help make your case. Seek out allies within and outside your organization. It is better to push too hard than to slowly bleed to death. Negotiate for Resources As you seek commitments for resources, keep these principles of effective negotiation in mind. Focus on underlying interests. Probe as deeply as possible to understand the agendas of your boss and any others from whom you need to secure resources. What is in it for them? Look for mutually beneficial exchanges. Seek resources that both support your boss’s agenda and advance your own. Look for ways to help peers advance their agendas in return for help with yours. Link resources to results. Highlight the performance benefits that will result if more resources are dedicated to your unit. Create the menu described earlier, laying out what you can achieve (and cannot achieve) with current resources and what different-sized increments would allow you to do. Planning the Style Conversation === Page 65 === People’s stylistic preferences affect how they learn, communicate, influence others, and make decisions. In the style conversation, your agenda is to determine how you and your boss can best work together on a continuing basis. This was the key challenge that Michael faced in working out his relationship with Vaughan. Even if your boss never becomes a close friend or mentor, it’s essential that you understand what it takes to build a productive working relationship. Diagnose Your Boss’s Style The first step is to diagnose your new boss’s working style and figure out how it jibes with your own. If you leave messages for her about an urgent problem, and she doesn’t respond quickly but then reproaches you for not giving her a heads-up about the problem, take note: your boss doesn’t use that mode of communication! How does your boss like to communicate? How often? What kinds of decisions does he want to be involved in, and when can you make calls on your own? Does your",

Pinpoint the specific ways in which your styles differ, and assess what those differences imply about how you will interact. Suppose you prefer to learn by talking with knowledgeable people, whereas your boss relies more on reading and analyzing hard data. What kinds of misunderstandings and problems might this difference in style cause, and how can you avoid them? Or suppose your new boss tends to micromanage, but you prefer a lot of independence. What can you do to manage this tension? You may find it helpful to talk to others who have worked with your boss in the past. Naturally, you must do this judiciously. Be careful not to be perceived as eliciting criticism of how the boss leads. Stick to less fraught issues, such as how the boss prefers to communicate. Listen to others’ perspectives, but base your evolving strategy chiefly on your own experience. Observe, too, how your boss deals with others. Is there consistency? If not, why not? Does the boss have favorites? Is he particularly prone to micromanaging certain issues? Has he come down hard on a few people because of unacceptable performance? Scope Out the Dimensions of Your Box Your boss will have a comfort zone about her involvement in decision making. Think of this zone as defining the boundaries of the decision-making box in which you will operate. What sorts of decisions does she want you to make on your own but tell her about? Are you free, for example, to make key personnel decisions? When does she want to be consulted before you decide? Is it when your actions touch on broader issues of policy—for example, in granting people leave? Or when there are hot political issues associated with some of the projects you’re working on? When does she want to make the decision herself? Initially, expect to be confined to a relatively small box. As your new boss gains confidence in you, the dimensions of the box should increase. If not, or if it remains too small to allow you to be effective, you may have to address the issue directly.

Of course you should not do anything that could compromise your ability to achieve superior business results, but do look for opportunities to smooth the day-to-day workings of your relationship. Others who have worked with your boss can tell you what approaches they found successful. Then judiciously experiment with the tactics that seem most promising in your case. When in doubt, simply ask your boss how he would prefer you to proceed. Surface the Difficult Issues When serious style differences arise, it’s best to address them directly. Otherwise, you run the risk that your boss will interpret a style difference as disrespect or even incompetence on your part. Raise the style issue before it becomes a source of irritation, and talk with your boss about how to accommodate both your styles. This conversation can smooth the path for both of you to achieve your goals. This is what Michael did, although he wisely waited to build credibility before addressing it. One proven strategy is to focus your early conversations on goals and results instead of how you achieve them. You might simply say that you expect to notice differences in how the two of you approach certain issues or decisions but that you’re committed to achieving the results to which you have both agreed. An assertion of this kind prepares your boss to expect differences. You may have to remind your boss periodically to focus on the results you’re achieving and not on your methods. It may also help to judiciously discuss style issues with someone your boss trusts, who can enlighten you about potential issues and solutions before you raise them directly with your boss. If you find the right adviser, he may even help you broach a difficult issue in a nonthreatening manner. Don’t make the mistake of trying to address all style issues in a single conversation. Nevertheless, an early dialogue explicitly devoted to style is an excellent place to start. Expect to continue to be attentive to, and adapt to, the boss’s style as your relationship evolves. Planning the Personal Development Conversation Finally, when your relationship with your boss has matured a bit (roughly the 90-day mark is a good rule of thumb), begin to discuss how you’re doing.

What are you doing well, and what do you need to do differently? What skills do you need to develop to do the job better? Are there shortcomings in your leadership capacities that you need to address? Are there projects or special assignments that you could get involved in (without sacrificing focus) that could strengthen your skills? It’s especially critical that you do this when you’re making key career passages. If you’re a first- time manager, get into the habit early of asking your boss for feedback and help in developing your supervisory skills. Your willingness to seek candid feedback on your strengths and weaknesses—and, critically, your ability to act on the feedback—sends a powerful message. The same principle holds whether you’re becoming a manager of managers for the first time, a === Page 67 === functional leader, a general manager, or a CEO. Whenever you are at a point in your career when success demands a different set of skills and attitudes, discipline yourself to be open to learning from others who have gone before you. Don’t restrict your focus to hard skills. The higher you rise, the more important the key soft skills of cultural and political diagnosis, negotiation, coalition building, and conflict management will become. Formal training can help, but developmental assignments—in project teams, in new parts of the organization, in different functions, in different locations—are indispensable in honing these key managerial skills. Working with Multiple Bosses You face even more daunting challenges in managing expectations if you have more than one boss (direct or dotted-line). The same principles hold, but the emphasis shifts. If you have multiple bosses, you must be sure to carefully balance perceived wins and losses among them. If one boss has substantially more power, then it makes sense to bias yourself somewhat in her direction early on, as long as you redress the balance, to the greatest extent possible, later. If you can’t get agreement by working with your bosses one-on-one, you must essentially force them to come to the table together to thrash issues out. Otherwise, you will get pulled to pieces. You should complete a version of table 4- 1 for each of your bosses, and look closely at where their views of the situations, expectations, and resources converge and where they",

Working at a Distance Managing when you are located far from your boss presents a different set of challenges. The risk is greater of falling out of step without realizing it. This puts the onus on you to exert even more discipline over communication, scheduling calls and meetings to be sure you stay aligned. It also is even more critical to establish clear and comprehensive metrics so that your boss gets a reasonable picture of what is going on and you can more effectively manage by exception. If it is humanly possible, you should plan to have one or more in-person meetings with your boss early on. It is essential to make face-to-face connections early on to begin to establish a basis of confidence and trust (the same is true if you’re leading a virtual team). So if this means you need to fight for the resources and fly halfway around the world, you should do it. Think, too, about good ways to carve out time with your boss, who is likely to be busy and buffeted by requests from people who are more physically present than you are. Identify windows of time when your boss is less likely to be completely occupied—for example, during the times when she is traveling to or from the office. Putting It All Together: Negotiating Your 90-Day Plan No matter what situation you’re entering, it can be useful to create a 90-day plan and get buy-in from === Page 68 === your boss. Usually, you will be able to devise a plan after a couple of weeks in the new job, when you have begun to connect with the organization and get the lay of the land. Your 90-day plan should be written, even if it consists only of bullet points. It should specify priorities and goals as well as milestones. Critically, you should share it with your boss and seek buy-in for it. It should serve as a “contract” between the two of you about how you’re going to spend your time, spelling out both what you will do and what you will not do. To begin to sketch out your plan, divide the 90 days into three blocks of 30 days. At the end of each block, you will have a review meeting with your boss. (Naturally, you’re likely to",

You should typically devote the first block of 30 days to learning and building personal credibility. Like Michael, you should negotiate for this early learning period and then try to hold your boss to that agreement. Then you can proceed to develop a learning agenda and learning plan for yourself. Set weekly goals for yourself, and establish a personal discipline of weekly evaluation and planning. Your key outputs at the end of the first 30 days will be a diagnosis of the situation, an identification of key priorities, and a plan for how you will spend the next 30 days. This plan should address where and how you will begin to seek some early wins. Your review meeting with your boss should focus on the situation and expectations conversations, with an eye to reaching consensus about the situation, clarification of expectations, and buy-in to your plan for the next 30 days. Continue the weekly discipline of evaluation and planning. At the 60-day mark, your review meeting should focus on assessing your progress toward the goals of your plan for the previous 30 days. You should also discuss what you plan to achieve in the next 30 days (that is, by the end of 90 days). Depending on the situation and your level in the organization, your goals at this juncture might include identifying the resources necessary to pursue major initiatives, fleshing out your initial assessments of strategy and structure, and presenting some early assessments of your team. Planning the Five Conversations with Your Team Finally, you won’t merely have a new boss; you are likely to be a new boss as well. You will almost certainly have new subordinates. Just as you need to develop a productive relationship with your new boss, so, too, will they need to work effectively with you. In the past, have you done a good job of helping subordinates with their transitions? What might you do differently this time? Think about how to apply all the advice in this chapter to working with your own direct reports. The golden rule of transitions is to transition others as you would wish to be transitioned yourself (see “The Golden Rule of Transitions”). The same five-conversation framework can help you build productive relationships with the people who report to you.

Get them to do some pre-work before the meeting—for example, reading the chapter on matching strategy to situation. See how fast you can accelerate their transitions. === Page 69 === The Golden Rule of Transitions Think about how you would like new bosses to help you transition into new roles. Ideally, what kinds of guidance and support would they give you? Now think about how you deal with new direct reports. What kinds of guidance and support do you give them? Now juxtapose these assessments. Do you transition others as you would wish to be transitioned yourself? If there is a big inconsistency between how you prefer to be dealt with as a new direct report and how you deal with new direct reports, then you are part of the problem. Helping direct reports accelerate their transitions is about more than being a good manager and contributing to others’ development. The faster your direct reports get up to speed, the better able they will be to help you reach your goals. Use table 4-3 to keep track of where you stand in having those key conversations with each of your reports. Table 4-3 The five conversations and your team List your team members in the first column.

She also was determined to change the authoritarian leadership culture exemplified by her predecessor. Before her promotion, Elena had been responsible for the highest-performing call center in the same organization, so she knew a lot about the problems other units had been facing with quality of service. Convinced that she could dramatically improve performance through more employee participation, she saw cultural change as a top priority. Elena began by communicating her goals to her former peers, now direct reports—the leaders of the company’s call centers across the globe. In a series of team calls and 1:1 meetings, she laid out her quality improvement goals and vision for a more participative, problem-solving culture. These early overtures generated little obvious reaction. Next, she initiated weekly meetings with each of the call center managers to review unit performance and discuss how they were working to improve it. Elena stressed that “the punishment culture is a thing of the past” and that she expected managers to coach employees. Cases involving significant disciplinary measures, she said, should be referred (on an interim basis) directly to her for review. Over time Elena learned which center managers were getting with the program and which ones were continuing to be punitive. She then conducted formal performance reviews and put two of the worst offenders on performance-improvement plans. One left almost immediately; she replaced him with a high-potential supervisor from the center she had run. Although it took some time, the other manager shaped up acceptably. Meanwhile, Elena focused on a critical aspect of the business: evaluation of customer satisfaction and improvement in quality of service. She appointed her best unit leader",

She also engaged a consultant to advise the managers on how to pursue this project, and she regularly reviewed their progress. When the team presented recommendations, she promptly implemented them on a pilot basis in the unit previously overseen by the departed supervisor. By the end of her first year, Elena had extended the new approach throughout the organization. Customer service had improved substantially, and climate surveys revealed striking improvements in morale and employee satisfaction. Elena succeeded in quickly creating momentum and building personal credibility by securing early wins. 1 By the end of the first few months, you want your boss, your peers, and your subordinates to feel that something new, something good, is happening. Early wins excite and energize people and === Page 72 === build your personal credibility. Done well, they help you create value for your new organization earlier and reach the break-even point much more quickly. Making Waves A seminal study of executives in transition found that they plan and implement change in distinct waves, as illustrated in figure 5-1 . 2 Following an early period of focused learning, these leaders begin an early wave of changes. The pace then slows to allow consolidation and deeper learning about the organization, and to allow people to catch their breath. Armed with more insight, these executives then implement deeper waves of change. A final, less extreme wave focuses on fine-tuning to maximize performance. By this point, most of these leaders are ready to move on. This research has direct implications for how you should manage your transition. It suggests that you should keep your ends clearly in mind when you devise your plan to secure early wins. The transition lasts only a few months, but you typically will remain in the same job for two to four years before moving on to a new position. To the greatest extent possible, your early wins should advance longer-term goals. FIGURE 5-1 Waves of change Plan Your Waves In planning for your transition (and beyond), focus on making successive waves of change. Each wave should consist of distinct phases: learning, designing the changes, building support, implementing the changes, and observing results. Thinking in this way can release you to spend time up front to",

If you keep changing things, it is impossible to figure out what is working and what is not. Unending change is also a surefire recipe for burning out your people. The goal of the first wave of change is to secure early wins. The new leader tailors early initiatives to build personal credibility, establish key relationships, and identify and harvest low- hanging fruit—the highest-potential opportunities for short-term improvements in organizational performance. Done well, this strategy helps the new leader build momentum and deepen his own === Page 73 === learning. The second wave of change typically addresses more fundamental issues of strategy, structure, systems, and skills to reshape the organization; deeper gains in organizational performance are achieved. But you will not get there if you don’t secure early wins in the first wave. Starting with the Goal Leaders in transition understandably are eager to get things moving. Thus, they naturally tend to focus on the problems that are easiest to fix quickly. This tactic is fine, up to a point. But be careful not to fall into the low-hanging fruit trap . This trap catches leaders when they expend most of their energy seeking early wins that don’t contribute to achieving their longer-term business objectives. It’s like trying to launch a rocket into orbit with nothing except a very big first stage; the risk is great that you’ll fall back to earth once the initial momentum fades. The implication: when you’re deciding where to seek early wins, you may have to forgo some of the low-hanging fruit and reach higher in the tree. As you strive to create momentum, therefore, keep in mind that your early wins must do double duty: they must help you build momentum in the short term and lay a foundation for achieving your longer-term business goals. So be sure that your plans for securing early wins, to the greatest extent possible, (1) are consistent with your agreed-to goals—what your bosses and key stakeholders expect you to achieve—and (2) help you introduce the new patterns of behavior you need to achieve those goals. Focus on Business Priorities The goals you have agreed to with your boss and other key stakeholders are the destination you’re striving to reach in measurable business objectives.

For Elena, her number 1 priority was to make significant improvements in customer satisfaction. The point is to define your goals so that you can lead with a distinct end point in mind. Identify and Support Behavioral Changes Your agreed-to goals are the destination, but the behavior of people in your organization is a key part of how you do (or don’t) get there. Put another way, if you are to achieve your goals in the allotted time, you may have to change dysfunctional patterns of behavior. Start by identifying the unwanted behaviors; for example, Elena wanted to reduce the fear and disempowerment in her organization. Then work out, as Elena did, a clear vision of how you would like people to behave by the end of your tenure in the job, and plan how your actions in pursuit of early wins will advance the process. What behaviors do people consistently display that undermine the potential for high performance? Take a look at table 5-1 , which lists some problematic behavior patterns, and then summarize your thoughts about the behaviors you would like to change. TABLE 5-1 === Page 74 === Problematic behavior patterns Adopting Basic Principles It’s crucial to get early wins, but it’s also important to secure them in the right way. Above all, of course, you want to avoid early losses, because it’s tough to recover once the tide is running against you. Here are some basic principles to consider. Focus on a few promising opportunities . It’s easy to take on too much during a transition, and the results can be ruinous. You cannot hope to achieve results in more than a couple of areas during your transition. Thus, it’s essential to identify the most promising opportunities and then focus relentlessly on translating them into wins. Think of it as risk management: pursue enough focal points to have a good shot at getting a significant success, but not so many that your efforts get diffused. Get wins that matter to your boss . It’s essential to get early wins that energize your direct reports and other employees. But your boss’s opinion about your accomplishments is crucial too. Even if you do not fully endorse her priorities, you must make them central in thinking through which early wins you will aim for. Addressing problems that",

Get wins in the right ways . If you achieve impressive results in a manner that is seen as manipulative, underhanded, or inconsistent with the culture, you’re setting yourself up for trouble. If Elena had gotten her key wins by being punitive, it would have undercut the larger === Page 75 === objective she was trying to achieve. An early win that is accomplished in a way that exemplifies the behavior you hope to instill in your new organization is a double win. Take your STARS portfolio into account . What constitutes an early win differs dramatically from one STARS business situation to another. Simply getting people to talk about the organization and its challenges can be a big accomplishment in a realignment, but it’s a waste of time in a turnaround. So think hard about what will build momentum best in each part of your portfolio. Will it be a demonstrated willingness to listen and learn? Will it be rapid, decisive calls on pressing business issues? Adjust for the culture . In some organizations, a win must be a visible individual accomplishment. In others, individual pursuit of glory, even if it achieves good results, is viewed as grandstanding and destructive of teamwork. In team-oriented organizations, early wins could come in the form of leading a team in the development of a new product idea or being viewed as a solid contributor and team player in a broader initiative. Be sure you understand what is and is not viewed as a win, especially if you’re onboarding into the organization. Identifying Your Early Wins Armed with (and guided by) an understanding of your goals and objectives for behavior change, you can identify where you will seek early wins. You should think about what you need to do in two phases: building personal credibility in roughly the first 30 days, and deciding which projects you will launch to achieve early performance improvements beyond that. (The actual time frames will of course depend on the situation.) Understand Your Reputation When you arrive, people will rapidly begin to assess you and your capabilities. In part, this evaluation will be based on what people think they already “know” about you. You can be sure people have talked to people who have talked to people who have worked",

The risk, of course, is that your reputation will become reality, because people tend to focus on information that confirms their beliefs and screen out information that doesn’t—the so-called confirmation bias . 3 The implication is that you need to figure out what role people are expecting you to play and then make an explicit decision about whether you will reinforce these expectations or confound them. Elena’s situation—leading former peers—is a special case in which people in the organization knew her, but in a different, more junior role. The risk for her was that they would expect her to be the same in her new role. So her job was to figure out ways to change how people perceived her. The broader challenges of leading former peers are summarized in the box “Leading Former Peers.” Leading Former Peers === Page 76 === To meet the classic challenges of moving from peer to boss, you should adopt the following principles: Accept the fact that relationships must change . An unfortunate price of promotion is that personal relationships with former peers must become less so. Close personal relationships are rarely compatible with effective supervisory ones. Focus early on rites of passage . The first days are about symbolism more than substance. So focus on rites of passage can help establish you in your new role—for example, having your new boss introduce you to your team and pass the baton. Reenlist your (good) former peers . For every leader who gets promoted, there are other ambitious souls who wanted the job but didn’t get it. So recognize that disappointed competitors will go through stages of adjustment. Focus on figuring out who can work for you and who can’t. Establish your authority deftly . You must walk the knife’s edge between over- and underasserting yourself. It can be effective to adopt a consult-and-decide approach when dealing with critical issues until former peers get used to making the calls, as long as you don’t make uninformed decisions. Focus on what’s good for the business . From the moment your appointment is announced, some former peers will be straining to discern whether you will play favorites or will seek to advance political agendas at their expense. One antidote is to adopt a relentless, principled focus",

Build Credibility In your first few weeks in your new job, you cannot hope to have a measurable impact on performance, but you can score small victories and signal that things are changing. Think of this as an effort to secure early, early wins by building your personal credibility. Your credibility, or lack of it, will depend on how people would answer the following questions about you: Do you have the insight and steadiness to make tough decisions? Do you have values that they relate to, admire, and want to emulate? Do you have the right kind of energy? Do you demand high levels of performance from yourself and others? For better or worse, they will begin to form opinions based on little data. Your early actions, good and bad, will shape perceptions. Once opinion about you has begun to harden, it is difficult to change. And the opinion-forming process happens remarkably quickly. So how do you build personal credibility? In part, it’s about marketing yourself effectively, much akin to building equity in a brand. You want people to associate you with attractive capabilities, attitudes, and values. There’s no single right answer for how to do this. In general, though, new leaders are perceived as more credible when they display these characteristics: Demanding but able to be satisfied . Effective leaders get people to make realistic commitments and then hold them responsible for achieving results. But if you’re never satisfied, you’ll sap people’s motivation. Know when to celebrate success and when to push for more. Accessible but not too familiar . Being accessible does not mean making yourself available === Page 77 === indiscriminately. It means being approachable, but in a way that preserves your authority. Decisive but judicious . New leaders communicate their capacity to take charge, perhaps by rapidly making some low-consequence decisions, without jumping too quickly into decisions that they aren’t ready to make. Early in your transition, you want to project decisiveness but defer some decisions until you know enough to make the right calls. Focused but flexible . Avoid setting up a vicious cycle and alienating others by coming across as rigid and unwilling to consider multiple solutions. Effective new leaders establish authority by zeroing in on issues but consulting others and encouraging input. They also know when to give people the flexibility to achieve results in",

There’s a fine line between building momentum and overwhelming your group or unit. Make things happen, but avoid pushing people to the point of burnout. Learn to pay attention to stress levels and pace yourself and others. Willing to make tough calls but humane . You may have to make tough calls right away, including letting go of marginal performers. Effective new leaders do what needs to be done, but they do it in ways that preserve people’s dignity and that others perceive as fair. Keep in mind that people watch not only what you do but also how you do it. Plan to Engage Because your earliest actions will have a disproportionate influence on how you’re perceived, think through how you will get connected to your new organization in the first few days in your new role. What messages do you want to get across about who you are and what you represent as a leader? What are the best ways to convey those messages? Identify your key audiences—direct reports, other employees, key outside constituencies—and craft a few messages tailored to each. These need not be about what you plan to do; that’s premature. They should focus instead on who you are, the values and goals you represent, your style, and how you plan to conduct business. Think about modes of engagement, too. How will you introduce yourself? Should your first meetings with direct reports be one-on-one or in a group? Will these meetings be informal get-to- know-you sessions, or will they immediately focus on business issues and assessment? What other channels, such as e-mail and video, will you use to introduce yourself more widely? Will you have early meetings at other locations where your organization has facilities? As you make progress in getting connected, identify and act as quickly as you can to remove minor but persistent irritants. Focus on strained external relationships, and begin to repair them. Cut out redundant meetings, shorten excessively long ones, or improve problems with physical work spaces. All this helps you build personal credibility early on. Finally, keep in mind that effective learning builds personal credibility. It’s never a bad thing to be seen as genuinely committed to understanding your new organization. It helps immunize you against the perception that you have come in with your mind made up about the organization’s problems and",

An early, visible focus on learning signals to the organization that you understand it has a unique history and dynamics. Of course, it’s important that you also be seen as a quick study and not, as was said of one president, that you have “a learning curve as flat as Kansas.” 4 Know, too, === Page 78 === when to shift the emphasis from learning to decision and action. Write Your Own Story Your actions during your first few weeks inevitably will have a disproportionate impact, because they are as much about symbolism as about substance. Early actions often get transformed into stories, which can define you as hero or villain. Do you take the time to informally introduce yourself to the support staff, or do you focus only on your boss, peers, and direct reports? Something as simple as this action can help brand you as either accessible or remote. How you introduce yourself to the organization, how you treat support staff, how you deal with small irritants—all these pieces of behavior can become the kernels of stories that circulate widely. To nudge your mythology in a positive direction, look for and leverage teachable moments . These are actions—such as the way Elena dealt with recalcitrant supervisors—that clearly display what you’re about; they also model the kinds of behavior you want to encourage. They need not be dramatic statements or confrontations. They can be as simple, and as hard, as asking the penetrating question that crystallizes your group’s understanding of a key problem the members are confronting. Launch Early-Win Projects Building personal credibility and developing some key relationships help you get immediate wins. Soon, however, you should identify opportunities to get quick, tangible performance improvement in the business. The best candidates are problems you can tackle quickly with modest expenditures and will yield visible operational and financial gains. Examples include bottlenecks that restrict productivity and incentive programs that undermine performance by causing conflict. Identify three or four key areas, at most, where you will seek to achieve rapid improvement. Use the early wins evaluation tool in table 5-2 to gauge the potential. But keep in mind that if you take on too many initiatives, you risk losing focus. Think about risk management: build a promising portfolio of early-win initiatives so that big successes in one will balance disappointments in others. Then focus relentlessly on getting results.",

C ANDIDATE EARLY WIN __________________________________________________ For each of the following questions, circle the response that best describes the potential. === Page 79 === To set the stage for securing early wins, make sure your learning agenda specifically addresses how you will identify promising opportunities for improvement. Then translate your goals into specific projects to secure early wins, using the following guidelines: Keep your long-term goals in mind . Your actions should, to the greatest extent possible, serve your agreed-to business goals and supporting objectives for behavior change. Identify a few promising focal points . Focal points are areas or processes (such as the customer service processes for Elena) in which improvement can dramatically strengthen the organization’s overall operational or financial performance. Concentration on a few focal points will help you reduce the time and energy needed to achieve tangible results. And success in improving performance early in these areas will win you freedom and space to pursue more extensive changes. Launch early-win projects . Manage your early-win initiatives as projects, targeted at your chosen focal points. This is what Elena did when she appointed a team to improve customer service in her new position. Elevate change agents . Identify the people in your new unit, at all levels, who have the insight, drive, and incentives to advance your agenda. Promote them or appoint them to lead key projects, as Elena did. Leverage the early-win projects to introduce new behaviors . Your early-win projects should serve as models of how you want your organization, unit, or group to function in the future. Elena understood this when she engaged a consultant to help the team use the right methods to pursue the project so they could learn how best to do this. Use the project planning template in table 5-3 to plan projects with maximum impact.

Keep in mind there is no one best way to lead change; the best approaches depend on the situation. For example, approaches that work well in turnarounds, where there already is a sense of urgency, can fail miserably in realignments, where many people may be in denial about the need for change. So stay open to the possibility that you will lead change differently in different parts of your STARS portfolio. Planning Versus Learning Once you’ve identified the most important problems or issues you need to address, the next step is to decide whether to engage in planned change or collective learning. 5 The straightforward plan-then-implement approach to change works well when you’re sure you have the following key supporting planks in place: Awareness . A critical mass of people is aware of the need for change. Diagnosis . You know what needs to be changed and why. Vision . You have a compelling vision and a solid strategy. Plan . You have the expertise to put together a detailed plan. === Page 81 === Support . You have sufficiently powerful alliances to support implementation. This approach often works well in turnaround situations—for example, where people accept there is a problem, the fixes are more technical than cultural or political, and people are hungry for a solution. If any of these five conditions is not met, however, the pure planning approach to change can get you into trouble. If you’re in a realignment, for example, and people are in denial about the need for change, they’re likely to greet your plan with stony silence or active resistance. You may therefore need to build awareness of the need for change. Or you may need to sharpen the diagnosis of the problem, create a compelling vision and strategy, develop a solid cross-functional implementation plan, or create a coalition in support of change. To accomplish any of these goals, you would be well advised to focus on setting up a collective learning process and not on developing and imposing change plans. If many people in the organization are willfully blind to emerging problems, for example, you must put in place a process to pierce this veil. Rather than mount a frontal assault",

You can do this by exposing key people to new ways of operating and thinking about the business, such as new data on customer satisfaction and competitive offerings. Or you can do some benchmarking of best-in-class organizations, getting the group to analyze how your best competitors perform. Or you can persuade people to envision new approaches to doing things—for example, by scheduling an off-site meeting to brainstorm about key objectives or ways to improve existing processes. The key, then, is to figure out which parts of the change process can be best addressed through planning, and which are better dealt with through collective learning. Think of a change you want to make in your new organization. Now use the diagnostic flow chart in figure 5-2 to figure out where planning and learning processes are likely to be important to your success. FIGURE 5-2 Diagnostic framework for managing change === Page 82 === Get Started on Behavior Change As you plan to get early wins, remember that the means you use are as important as the ends you achieve. The initiatives you put in place to get early wins should do double duty by establishing new standards of behavior. Elena did this when she carefully staffed and coached her project team and then quickly implemented its recommendations. To change your organization, you will likely have to change its culture. This is a difficult undertaking. Your organization may have well-ingrained bad habits that you want to break. But we know how difficult it is for one person to change habitual patterns in any significant way, never mind a mutually reinforcing collection of people. Simply blowing up the existing culture and starting over is rarely the right answer. People—and organizations—have limits on the change they can absorb all at once. And organizational cultures invariably have virtues as well as faults; they provide predictability and can be sources of pride. If you send the message that there is nothing good about the existing organization and its culture, you will rob people of a key source of stability in times of change. You also will deprive yourself of a potential wellspring of energy you could tap to improve performance. The key is to identify both the good",

These functional aspects of the familiar culture are a bridge that can help carry people from the past to the future. Match Strategy to Situation === Page 83 === The choice of behavior-change techniques should be a function of your group’s structure, processes, skills, and—above all—situation. Consider again the difference between turnaround and realignment situations. In a turnaround, you face a combination of time pressure and the need to rapidly identify and secure the defensible core of the business. Often, techniques such as bringing in new people from the outside and setting up project teams to pursue specific performance-improvement initiatives are a good fit. Contrast this with realignments, where you are well advised to start with less obvious approaches to behavior change. By changing performance measures and starting benchmarking, for example, you set the stage for collectively creating a vision for realigning the business. Avoiding Predictable Surprises Finally, all your efforts to secure early wins could come to naught if you don’t pay attention to identifying ticking time bombs and preventing them from exploding in your face. If they do explode, your focus will instantly shift to continuous firefighting, and your hopes for systematically getting established and building momentum will fly out the window. Some bolts from the blue really do come out of the blue. When this happens, you must grit your teeth and mount the best crisis response you can. But far more often, new leaders are taken off track by predictable surprises. These are situations in which people have all the information necessary to recognize and defuse a time bomb but fail to do so. 6 This often happens because the new leader simply doesn’t look in the right places or ask the right questions. As mentioned earlier, we all have preferences about the types of problems we like to work on and those we prefer to avoid or don’t feel competent to address. But you need to discipline yourself either to dig into areas where you’re not fully comfortable or to find trustworthy people with the necessary expertise to do so. Another reason for predictable surprises is that different parts of the organization have different pieces of the puzzle, but no one puts them together. Every organization has its information silos.

Use the following set of questions to identify areas where potential problems may be lurking: The external environment . Could trends in public opinion, government action, or economic conditions precipitate major problems for your unit? Examples include a change in government policy that favors competitors or unfavorably influences your prices or costs; a major shift in public opinion about the health or safety implications of using your product; an emerging economic crisis in a developing country. Customers, markets, competitors, and strategy . Are there developments in the competitive situation confronting your organization that could pose major challenges? Examples include a study suggesting that your product is inferior to that of a competitor; a new competitor that is offering a lower-cost substitute; a price war. Internal capabilities . Are there potential problems with your unit’s processes, skills, and capabilities that could precipitate a crisis? Examples include an unexpected loss of key === Page 84 === personnel; major quality problems at a key plant; a product recall. Organizational politics . Are you in danger of unwittingly stepping on a political land mine? Examples include certain people in your unit who are untouchable, but you don’t know it; your failure to recognize that a key peer is subtly undermining you. As you plan how to secure early wins, keep in mind your overarching goal: creating a virtuous cycle that reinforces wanted behavior and contributes to helping you achieve your agreed-to goals for the organization. Remember that you’re aiming at modest but significant early improvements so that you can pursue more fundamental changes. Secure Early Wins—Checklist 1 . Given your agreed-to business goals, what do you need to do during your transition to create momentum for achieving them? 2 . How do people need to behave differently to achieve these goals? Describe as vividly as you can the behaviors you need to encourage and those you need to discourage. 3 . How do you plan to connect yourself to your new organization? Who are your key audiences, and what messages would you like to convey to them? What are the best modes of engagement? 4 . What are the most promising focal points to get some early improvements in performance and start the process of behavior change? 5 . What",

What predictable surprises could take you off track? === Page 85 === CHAPTER 6 Achieve Alignment Hannah Jaffey, a respected human resource consultant, was hired by a former client to be corporate vice president of human resources. She joined a company suffering from such intense conflict at the top that some senior executives were barely on speaking terms. Hannah had been brought in to support the CEO in making needed personnel changes and to rebuild the executive team. Hannah soon realized the organization’s structure and incentives system were at the root of the problems. A year earlier, the company, which had grown rapidly, had been reorganized into business units, each focusing on a specific product line. However, several of the units’ customer bases overlapped, and the new structure and incentives system discouraged cooperation. The result? Confused customers, conflicts over which units owned key customer relationships, and an inability to offer integrated solutions. The turmoil had begun to impact the financials, with top-line growth stalling and the CEO facing tough questioning from the board and investors. Convinced the company needed further structural change, Hannah laid out her case to the CEO. But he was reluctant to embark on another round of reorganization, and he remained convinced that the people were the problem. The organizational design was sound, he told Hannah, and with the right people in place it could work. In truth, there were significant weak links in the executive team. But Hannah knew that the people issues couldn’t be dealt with until the structure was put right. So she kept coming back to her boss. She did an in-depth diagnosis and brought to his attention instances in which incentive misalignments had unnecessarily stoked conflict. She also highlighted how other companies had organized themselves to deal with similar tensions. It took time, but eventually Hannah convinced the CEO to move the company to a hybrid structure. The focus of marketing and sales was returned to customer segments, leaving operations and R&D organized by product line, and a shared-services organization was created to provide finance, HR, IT, and supply chain support. The realignment worked: a year later, the company was functioning much more smoothly, customers were much happier, and robust growth had resumed. And it had become much clearer which executives needed to be replaced. The higher you climb",

No matter how charismatic you are as a leader, you cannot hope to do much if your organization is fundamentally out of alignment. You will feel as if you’re pushing a boulder uphill every day. If you have the scope to alter direction, structure, processes, and skills in your new position, you should begin to analyze the architecture of your organization and assess alignment among these key === Page 86 === elements. In the first few months you can’t hope to do much more than conduct a solid diagnosis and perhaps get started on the most pressing alignment issues. But it’s important to get a handle on what needs to be done so that you can focus some of your early-win projects appropriately and lay the foundation for a subsequent, deeper wave of change. Even if, like Hannah, you lack the authority to unilaterally alter the architecture of your new organization, you should focus on assessing organizational alignment. Look at how your piece of the puzzle fits (or doesn’t fit) into the bigger picture. Think about whether you need to convince influential people—your boss or your peers—that serious misalignments are a key impediment to achieving superior performance. Also, keep in mind that a thorough understanding of organizational systems can help you build credibility with people higher in the organization—and demonstrate your potential for more-senior positions. Avoiding Common Traps Many leaders rely on simplistic fixes to address complicated organizational problems, and they end up committing malpractice. Be alert to these common pitfalls: Making changes for change’s sake . The temptation is great for newly appointed leaders to make rapid, visible changes to strategies or structures, whether or not these elements are the right areas for focus. Often, leaders feel self-imposed pressure to put their stamp on the organization and seek to make changes before they really understand the business; it’s ready, shoot, aim. Once again, the action imperative creates a sure recipe for disaster. Not adjusting for the STARS situation . There is no one best way to lead change. The right way to drive organizational alignment in a turnaround (with a focus on rapid and often radical shifts) is very different",

So it’s essential not to adopt a one-size-fits-all approach to change but rather to understand the best ways to proceed in the various STARS situations. Trying to restructure your way out of deeper problems . Overhauling your organization’s structure when the real issues lie in the processes, skill bases, and culture can amount to rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic . Resist doing so until you understand whether restructuring will address the root causes of the problems. Otherwise, you may create new misalignments and have to backtrack, disrupting your organization and damaging your credibility. Creating structures that are too complex . This is a related trap. It may indeed make sense, as it did in Hannah’s situation, to implement a matrix structure. Done well, matrices foster shared accountability and help you work through creative tension. But take care to strike the right balance and not diffuse decision making or introduce sclerotic complexity. Strive, where possible, for clear lines of accountability. Simplify the structure to the greatest degree possible without compromising core goals. Overestimating your organization’s capacity to absorb change . It’s easy to envision an ambitious === Page 87 === new strategic direction or shift in structure. In practice, though, it can be difficult for people to change in response to large-scale shifts, especially if they have experienced a string of such changes in the recent past. Move quickly if you need to—for example, in a turnaround. But proceed incrementally if the STARS situation permits—for example, in realignments or sustaining-success situations. Designing Organizational Architecture Begin by thinking of yourself as the architect of your unit or group. This may be a familiar role for you, but it probably isn’t. Few leaders get systematic training in organizational design. Because leaders typically have limited control over organizational design early in their careers, they learn little about it. It’s commonplace for less-senior people to complain about obvious misalignments and to wonder why “those idiots” higher up tolerate clearly dysfunctional arrangements. By the time you reach the midsenior levels of most organizations, however, you are well on your way to becoming one of those idiots. You’re therefore well advised to begin learning something about how to assess and design organizations. To design (or redesign) your organization, start by",

This is illustrated for an entire business in figure 6-1 ; you may need to focus on only your piece. The “open” part refers to the reality that organizations are open to (that is, those elements they influence and are influenced by). This reality comprises (1) key players in the external environment, including customers, distributors, suppliers, competitors, governments, NGOs, investors, and the media, and (2) the internal environment: climate, morale, and culture. So leaders’ architectural choices must position the organization to respond to, as well as shape, the realities of the external and internal environments. FIGURE 6-1 Elements of organizational architecture === Page 88 === The “systems” part highlights the fact that organizational architectures consist of distinct, interacting elements: strategic direction, structure, core processes, and skill bases. The implication is that you can work on individual elements—for example, change the strategy, alter the structure, streamline a process, or hire people with a different skill set—but you shouldn’t do so without thinking through the impact on the other elements. Specifically all four elements of organizational architecture need be aligned to work together. 1 Strategic direction . The organization’s mission, vision, and strategy Structure . How people are organized in units and how their work is coordinated, measured, and incentivized Core processes . The systems used to add value through the processing of information and materials Skill bases . The capabilities of key groups of people in the organization Of course you need to have the right strategic direction to move forward effectively. But misalignments involving any of the other elements can make even the best strategy useless. Strategic direction drives the other elements and is influenced by them: if you decide to change your group’s direction, you will probably have to alter its structure, processes, and skills to create a fully aligned architecture. Diagnosing Misalignments Organizations can end up misaligned in many ways. Your goal during your first 90 days should be to identify potential misalignments and design a plan for correcting them. Common types of === Page 89 === misalignments include the following: Misalignments between strategic direction and skill bases . Suppose you head an R&D group and your goal is to increase the number of new product ideas your team generates and tests. However, your staff is not up to speed on the latest techniques that would let you run more experiments",

Misalignments between strategic direction and core processes . Imagine that you lead a marketing group whose mission is to focus on meeting the needs of a new customer segment. If your team has not established an effective way to compile and analyze information about those customers, your group’s systems fail to support the direction. There is a mismatch between strategic direction and core processes. Misalignments between structure and processes . Suppose you manage a product development group whose members are organized by product line. The rationale for this structure is that it focuses specialized technical expertise on specific products. But this structure has a downside: the group does not have efficient systems for sharing best practices among the various product teams. The resulting mismatch between structure and processes would make it difficult for the entire group to perform optimally. Misalignments between structure and skills . Suppose the business has recently moved from a functional structure to a matrix structure in an effort to balance product-related and functional decisions. People are used to relying on authority and functional reporting lines to get things done, but now they need to use influence and conflict management skills. The shift in structure has created a mismatch with needed skills that will need to be addressed. Getting Started Aligning an organization is like preparing for a long sailing trip. First, you need to be clear on whether your destination (the mission and goals) and your route (the strategy) are the right ones. Then you can figure out which boat you need (the structure), how to outfit it (the processes), and which mix of crew members is best (the skill bases). Throughout the journey, you keep an eye out for reefs that are not on the charts. The underlying point is that there is a logic to organizational alignment. It’s likely to cause problems if you try to change the structure before figuring out whether the direction is the right one. Also, you cannot fully assess the fitness of your existing crew until you have a handle on your destination, route, and boat, although you certainly can get started. Here’s how: 1 . Begin with strategic direction . Take a hard look at how your unit is positioned with respect to the larger organization’s goals and your agreed-to priorities. Make sure your",

Look at supporting structure, processes, and skills . Look at whether your group’s existing structure, processes, and skill bases support the strategic direction—either the existing one (if you decide === Page 90 === not to change it) or the one you envision. Dig into and understand the relationships among these elements. If one or more of them is ill suited to the mission or strategy you have in mind, figure out how you will either adapt your direction or build (or acquire) the capabilities you need. 3 . Decide how and when you will introduce the new strategic direction . Armed with a deeper understanding of your group’s current capabilities, chart a path for shifting direction (if such a shift is necessary). Sketch out changes in positioning (markets, customers, and suppliers) as well as changes in supporting capabilities. Then adopt a realistic time frame for making these changes. 4 . Think through the correct sequencing . Different situations demand different approaches to bringing organizations into alignment. In a turnaround, the right approach often is to alter the strategy (which typically is not adequate), then to bring the structure into alignment with it, and then to focus on supporting processes and skills. In a realignment, however, strategic direction and structure often are not the real source of the difficulties. Instead, they frequently lie in the processes and skill bases of the organization, and these are the places to focus on. 5 . Close the loop . As you learn more about your group’s structure, processes, and skills, you will gain insight into the team’s capabilities and its cultural capacity for change. This insight will in turn deepen your understanding of what changes in strategic positioning are possible over what time period. Defining Strategic Direction Strategic direction encompasses mission, vision, and strategy. Mission is about what will be achieved, vision is about why people should feel motivated to perform at a high level, and strategy is about how resources should be allocated and decisions made to accomplish the mission. If you keep in mind the what, the why, and the how, you won’t get lost in debates about what a mission is, what a vision is, and what a strategy is. Some fundamental questions about strategic direction concern what the organization will do and, critically, what it will not",

What difficult-to-reverse past commitments do we have to live with or try to unwind? It is beyond the scope of this book to delve deeply into the development of strategic direction, but excellent resources are available to help you answer these questions. Our focus here is on assessing the current direction by looking at its coherence, adequacy, and implementation. Assess Coherence Is there a clear logic to the choices that have been made about customers, products, technologies, plans, and resource commitments? To assess whether the elements of strategic direction fit together, you need to look at the logic behind the strategy to ensure that it makes sense overall. Have the people who defined it thought through all its ramifications and the practical aspects of implementing it? How do you evaluate the logic of the organization’s strategic direction? Start by looking at documents that describe your group’s mission, vision, and strategy. Then disassemble them into their components: markets, products, technologies, functional plans, and goals. Ask yourself, Do the various dimensions support one another? Is there a logical thread connecting the various parts? To be more specific, is there an obvious connection between market analysis and the group’s objectives? Does the product development budget jibe with the capital investments projected in the operations part of the strategy? Are plans in place to train salespeople for new products in the pipeline? If the organization’s strategic direction makes sense overall, you will spot such connections easily.

Your group may have a well-thought-through and logically integrated strategic direction. But is it also adequate? That is, will it empower the group to carry out what it needs to do to succeed—and to help the larger organization succeed—in the next two or three years? To assess adequacy, use these three approaches: Ask probing questions . Does your boss believe the current direction will provide enough return on the effort your group will expend to implement it? Are there plans in place to secure, develop, and preserve resources for carrying it out? Are profit and other targets high enough to keep the group on the right track? Is enough money earmarked for capital investment? For research? Use a variation on the well-known SWOT method . See the box “From SWOT to TOWS.” Probe the history of how strategic direction got defined . Find out who drove the process of defining strategic direction. Was it done in a rush? If so, the developers might not have thought through all the ramifications. Did it take a long time? If so, it might represent a lowest-common- denominator compromise that emerged from a political battle. Any mistakes during the development process could compromise the strategy’s adequacy. === Page 92 === From SWOT to TOWS SWOT is arguably the most useful (and certainly the most misunderstood) framework for conducting strategic analysis. The reason has to do with how the tool was developed and, critically, how it was named. SWOT—an acronym for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats—was originally developed by a team at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the late 1960s. 2 The group came up with the idea of simultaneously analyzing internal capabilities (strengths and weaknesses) and developments in the external environment (threats and opportunities) to identify strategic priorities and develop plans to address them. Unfortunately, the developers named their method SWOT, with the implication that the analysis should be carried out in that order—first, internal strengths and weaknesses, and then external opportunities and threats. This implied hierarchy has created no end of problems for those who use the methodology to drive strategy discussions in teams. The problem is that in the absence of something to anchor the discussion, an analysis of organizational strengths and weaknesses can very easily become abstract, undirected navel-gazing. As a result, groups often fail in trying to",

The correct approach is to start with the environment and then analyze the organization. The first step is to assess the organization’s external environment, looking for emerging threats and potential opportunities. Naturally this assessment must be conducted by people who are grounded in the reality of the organization and knowledgeable about its environment. Having identified potential threats and opportunities, the group should next evaluate them with reference to organizational capabilities. Does the organization have weaknesses that make it particularly vulnerable to specific threats? Does the organization have strengths that would permit it to pursue specific opportunities? The final step is to translate these assessments into a set of strategic priorities, blunting critical threats and pursuing high-potential opportunities. These are then the inputs to a more extensive strategic planning process. The confusion that has flowed from naming the method SWOT is so pervasive that a name change is probably in order. The alternative? Call it TOWS, so that people get the right cues about the best order for conducting the process. Assess Implementation Have the mission, vision, and strategy of your organization been pursued energetically? If not, why not? Look at how your group’s strategic direction is being implemented—what people are doing and not what they are saying. This approach will help you pinpoint whether problems stem from inadequacies in formulation or implementation . Ask yourself these kinds of questions: Is our overall pattern of decisions consistent with our defined direction? What goals does the organization actually seem to be pursuing? Are we using the specified performance metrics to make day-to-day decisions? If implementation requires teamwork and cross-functional integration, are people acting as teams and collaborating across functions? If implementation requires the development of new employee skills, is a learning-and- development infrastructure in place to develop those skills? Your answers to these kinds of questions will tell you whether to push for changes in your group’s strategic direction or in its implementation. Modify Strategic Direction Suppose you discover serious flaws in the mission, vision, and strategy you have inherited. Can you === Page 93 === radically change them or the way they’re implemented? That depends on two factors: the STARS situation you’re entering, and your ability to persuade others and build support for your ideas. If you believe",

If you conclude that the existing strategy will move the group forward, but neither fast enough nor far enough, the wisest course may be to tweak it early on and plan for bigger changes later. For example, you might raise the targeted revenue goals modestly or recommend investing in a needed technology sooner than the strategic direction calls for. More fundamental changes should wait until you’ve learned more and have built support among key constituencies. Shaping Your Group’s Structure Whether or not you decide to change the strategic direction of your organization, you still need to assess the adequacy of the structure. If the structure doesn’t support the strategy—either the existing one or a new one you plan to put in place—your organization’s energies will not be directed appropriately. One caution: much of an organization’s power gets allocated via its structure, because it defines who has the authority to do what. So take care not to take on structural change unless it is obvious that it’s needed—for example, in turnaround or rapid-growth scenarios. Tackling structural change early on can be particularly perilous in realignments, where there isn’t a burning platform to drive the change process. What is structure exactly? Most simply, your group’s structure is the way it organizes people and technology to support the mission, vision, and strategy. Structure consists of the following elements: Units: How your direct reports are grouped, such as by function, product, or geographical area Reporting relationships and integration mechanisms: How lines of reporting and accountability are set up to coordinate effort, and how work among units is integrated Decision rights and rules: Who is empowered to make what kinds of decisions, and what rules should be applied to align decisions with strategy Performance measurement and incentive systems: The performance-evaluation metrics and incentive systems that are in place Assess Structure Before you begin to generate ideas for reshaping your group’s structure, look into the interaction of the four structural elements. Are the pieces out of tune or in harmony? Ask yourself these questions: Does the grouping of team members help us achieve our mission and implement the strategy? Are the right people in the right places to work toward our core objectives? Do reporting relationships help align effort? Is it clear who",

Between individual incentives and group incentives? If you’re in a start-up situation—and therefore forming a new group—you will not have existing structures to evaluate. Instead, think about how you want the structural pieces to work in your group. Grapple with the Trade-Offs There is no perfect organizational structure; every one embodies trade-offs. Thus, your challenge is to find the right balance for your situation. As you consider changes in your group’s structure, keep in mind some common problems that can arise: The organization has silos of excellence . When you group people with similar experience and capabilities, they can accumulate deep wells of expertise. But they can also become isolated and compartmentalized. The implication is that you need to pay attention to how integration happens. This includes looking at who is responsible for bridging the chasms between functions, as well as identifying whether the right integration mechanisms, such as cross- functional teams and group performance incentives, are in place. Employees’ decision-making scope is too narrow or too broad . A good general rule is that decisions should be made by the people who have the most relevant knowledge, as long as their incentives encourage them to do what is best for the organization. If your group’s decision- making process is centralized, you (and perhaps several other individuals) can decide quickly. But you may be forgoing the benefit of the wisdom of others who have better information to make certain of those decisions. This structure can lead to ill-informed decisions and can tax those who make all the decisions. If, on the other hand, people are given decision-making scope but do not understand the larger implications of their choices, they may make unwise calls. Employees have incentives to do the wrong things . The best predictor of what people will do is what they are incentivized to do. Effective leaders seek to align the interests of individual decision makers with the interests of the group as a whole. This is",

Problems arise when measurement and compensation schemes fail to reward employees for either their individual or their collective efforts. Problems also arise when rewards advance employees’ individual interests at the expense of the group’s broader goals—for example, when multiple employees who could serve the same set of customers lack incentives to cooperate. This was the problem confronting Hannah in the story at the beginning of the chapter. Reporting relationships lead to compartmentalization or diffusion of accountability . Reporting === Page 95 === relationships help you observe and control the workings of your group, clarify responsibility, and encourage accountability. Hierarchical reporting relationships make these tasks easier but can lead to compartmentalization and poor information sharing. Complex reporting arrangements, such as matrix structures, broaden information sharing and reduce compartmentalization but can diffuse accountability. Aligning Core Processes Core processes (often referred to as “systems”) enable your group to transform information, materials, and knowledge into value in the form of commercially viable products or services, new knowledge or ideas, productive relationships, or anything else the larger organization considers essential. Again, as with structure, ask yourself whether the processes currently in place support your mission, vision, and strategy. Make the Right Trade-Offs Keep in mind that the extent and types of processes you need depend on the trade-offs you need to make. Think, for example, about whether your primary goal is to drive flawless execution or to stimulate innovation. 3 You can’t hope to execute with high levels of quality and reliability (and low costs) without an intensive focus on developing processes that specify both the ends and the means (methods, techniques, tools) in exquisite detail. Obvious examples are manufacturing plants and service delivery organizations. But these same sorts of processes can impede innovation. So if stimulating innovation is your goal, you may need to develop processes that focus on defining ends and rigorously checking progress toward achieving them at key milestones, and not so much on controlling the means people use to achieve the results. Analyze Processes A credit card company that sought to identify its core processes came up with the results shown in table 6-1 . It then mapped and improved each of these processes, developing appropriate measurement schemes and altering reward systems to better align behaviors. It also focused",

For critical tasks that were insufficiently under control, the company revamped procedures and introduced new support tools. The result was a dramatic increase in both customer satisfaction and the productivity of the organization. Your unit or group may have just as many processes as the credit card company. Your first challenge is to identify those processes and then to decide which of them are most important to your strategy. For example, suppose your group’s strategy emphasizes customer satisfaction over product development. You would want to ensure that all the processes involved in delivery of products or services to customers support that goal. TABLE 6-1 Process analysis example === Page 96 === Align Processes with Structure If your group’s core processes are to support its strategic direction, they must also align with the unit’s structure (the way people and work are organized). We can compare this relationship to the human body. Our anatomy—skeleton, musculature, skin, and other components—is the structural foundation for the body’s normal functions. Our physiology—circulation, respiration, digestion, and so on—is the set of systems (or processes) that enable the various parts of the body to work together. In organizations, as in human bodies, both the structure and the processes must be sound and must reinforce one another. To evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of each core process, you should examine four aspects: Productivity . Does the process efficiently transform knowledge, materials, and labor into value? Timeliness . Does the process deliver the desired value in a timely manner? Reliability . Is the process sufficiently reliable, or does it break down too often? Quality . Does the process deliver value in a way that consistently meets required quality standards? When processes and structure mesh with each other, the good results are clear to see. For example, a customer service organization structured around specific customer segments also shares information across teams and responds effectively to issues that affect all customer groups. But when processes and structure are at odds—as when different teams compete for the same set of customers using different sales processes—they hamstring one another and subvert the group’s strategy. Improve Core Processes How do you actually improve a core process? Start by making a process (or work-flow ) map —a straightforward diagram of exactly how the tasks in a particular process flow through the individuals === Page 97 === and groups who handle them.",

Ask the individuals responsible for each stage of the process to chart the process flow from beginning to end. Then ask the team to look for bottlenecks and problem interfaces between individuals responsible for adjacent sets of tasks. For example, errors or delays may occur when someone in customer relations communicates to the fulfillment group the need for special handling of an order. Process failures are commonplace during hand-offs of this kind. Work with the team to identify opportunities for high-leverage improvements. FIGURE 6-2 A process map Process analysis stimulates collective learning. It helps the entire group understand exactly who does what, within and between units or groups, to carry out a particular process. Creating a process or work-flow map also sheds light on how problems arise. You, your boss, and your group can then decide how best to improve the process—for example, by streamlining and automating work flows. A few words of caution. You are probably responsible for a number of processes. If so, manage them as a portfolio, focusing on a few at a time. Take care to factor in your organization’s capacity to absorb change. Developing Your Group’s Skill Bases Do your direct reports have the skills and knowledge they need to perform your group’s core processes superbly—and thus to support the strategy you have identified? If not, the entire architecture of your group could be compromised. A skill base comprises these four types of knowledge: Individual expertise . Gained through training, education, and experience Relational knowledge . An understanding of how to work together to integrate individual knowledge to achieve specified goals Embedded knowledge . The core technologies on which your group’s performance depends, === Page 98 === such as customer databases or R&D technologies Metaknowledge . The awareness of where to go to get critical information—for example, through external affiliations such as research institutions and technology partners Identify Gaps and Resources The overarching goal of assessing your group’s capabilities is to identify (1) critical gaps between needed and existing skills and knowledge and (2) underutilized resources, such as partially exploited technologies and squandered expertise.

Treat this as a visioning exercise in which you imagine the ideal knowledge mix. Then assess your group’s existing skills, knowledge, and technologies. What gaps do you see? Which of them can be repaired quickly, and which will take more time? To identify underutilized resources, search for individuals or groups in your unit who have performed much better than average. What has enabled them to do so? Do they enjoy resources (technologies, methods, materials, and support from key people) that could be exported to the rest of your unit? Have promising product ideas been sitting on the shelf because of lack of interest or investment? Could existing production resources be adapted to serve new sets of customers? Changing Architecture to Change Culture Keep in mind that culture is not something you can change directly. It is powerfully influenced by the four elements of organizational architecture, as well as by leadership behaviors. The implication is that to change the culture, you need to change the architecture as well as reinforce what you’re trying to do with the right leadership. One example is changing the metrics by which you judge success and then aligning employees’ objectives and incentives with those new measures. For instance, consider changing the balance between individual and group incentives. Does success require people to work closely and coordinate with one another—for example, in a new-product development team? If so, then put more weight on group incentives. Do people in your group operate independently—for example, in a sales unit? If so, and if their individual contributions to the business can be measured, then place more emphasis on individual incentives. Getting Aligned Draw on all the analyses discussed in this chapter to develop a plan for aligning your organization. If you’re repeatedly frustrated in your efforts to get people to adopt more productive behaviors, step back and ask whether organizational misalignments might be creating problems. === Page 99 === ACHIEVE ALIGNMENT—CHECKLIST 1 .

The extent of the challenge became clearer when he read the previous year’s performance evaluations for his new team. Everyone was either outstanding or marginal; there was nobody in between. It seemed his predecessor had played favorites. Conversations with his new direct reports and a thorough review of operating results confirmed Liam’s suspicion that the performance evaluations were skewed. In particular, the VP of marketing seemed reasonably competent but by no means a minor god. Unfortunately, he believed his own press. The VP of sales struck Liam as a solid performer who had been scapegoated for poor judgment calls by Liam’s predecessor. The relationship between marketing and sales was understandably tense. Liam recognized that one or both of the VPs would probably have to go. He met with each of them separately and bluntly told them how he viewed their performance ratings. He then laid out detailed two-month plans for each. Meanwhile, he and his VP for human resources quietly launched outside searches for both positions. Liam also held skip-level meetings with midlevel people to assess the depth of talent and to look for promising candidates for the top jobs. By the end of his third month, Liam had signaled to the marketing VP that he would not make it; he soon left and was replaced by one of his direct reports. Meanwhile, the head of sales had risen to Liam’s challenge. Now Liam was confident he had strong performers in these two key positions and was ready to move forward. Liam recognized that he couldn’t afford to have the wrong people on his team. If, like most new leaders, you inherit a group of direct reports, it is essential to build your team to marshal the talent you need to achieve superior results. The most",

If you succeed in creating a high-performance team, you can exert tremendous leverage in value creation. If not, you will face severe difficulties, for no leader can hope to achieve much alone. Bad early personnel choices will almost certainly haunt you. But even though finding the right people is essential, it is not enough. Begin by assessing existing team members (direct and indirect reports) to decide what changes you need to make. Then devise a plan for getting new people and moving the people you retain into the right positions—without doing too much damage to short-term performance in the process. Even this is not enough. You still need to align and motivate your team members to propel them in desired directions. Finally, you must establish new processes to promote teamwork. Avoiding Common Traps === Page 101 === Many new leaders stumble when it comes to building their teams. The result may be a significant delay in reaching the break-even point, or it may be outright derailment. These are some of the characteristic traps into which you can fall: Criticizing the previous leadership . There is nothing to be gained by criticizing the people who led the organization before you arrived. This doesn’t mean that you need to condone poor past performance, nor does it mean that you can’t highlight problems. Of course you need to evaluate the impact of previous leadership, but rather than point out others’ mistakes, concentrate on assessing current behavior and results and on making the changes necessary to support improved performance. Keeping the existing team too long . Unless you are in a start-up, you do not get to build a team from scratch; you inherit a team and must mold it into what you need to achieve your A-item priorities. Some leaders make major changes in their teams too precipitously, but it is more common to keep people longer than is wise. Whether because they’re afflicted with hubris (“These people have not performed well because they lacked a leader like me”) or because they shy away from tough personnel calls, leaders end up with less-than-outstanding teams. This means they and the other strong performers must shoulder more of the load themselves. The extent of team change and the time frame for making shifts depends on the STARS situation you confront; it",

Also, there may be constraints on your ability to make changes; you may have to accept that and figure out how to get the most out of the people you’ve inherited—for example, by defining roles. In any case, you should establish deadlines for reaching conclusions about your team and taking action within your 90-day plan, and then stick to them. Not balancing stability and change . Building a team you’ve inherited is like repairing a leaky ship in mid-ocean. You will not reach your destination if you ignore the necessary repairs, but you do not want to try to change too much too fast and sink the ship. The key is to find the right balance between stability and change. First and foremost, focus only on truly high-priority personnel changes early on. If you can make do for a while with a B-player, then do so. Not working on organizational alignment and team development in parallel . A ship’s captain cannot make the right choices about his crew without knowing the destination, the route, and the ship. Likewise, you can’t build your team in isolation from changes in strategic direction, structure, processes, and skill bases. Otherwise, you could end up with the right people in the wrong jobs. As figure 7-1 illustrates, your efforts to assess the organization and achieve alignment should go on in parallel with assessment of the team and necessary personnel changes. Not holding on to the good people . One experienced manager shared hard-won lessons about the dangers of losing good people. “When you shake the tree,” she said, “good people can fall out, too.” Her point is that uncertainty about who will and will not be on the team can lead your best people to move elsewhere. Although there are constraints on what you can say about who will stay and who will go, you should look for ways to signal to the top performers that you recognize their capabilities. A little reassurance goes a long way. === Page 102 === Undertaking team building before the core is in place . It is tempting to launch team-building activities right away, but this approach poses a danger; it strengthens bonds in a group, some of whose members may be leaving. So avoid explicit team-building activities until the team you want is largely in place.",

Making implementation-dependent decisions too early . When successful implementation of key initiatives requires buy-in from your team, you should judiciously defer making decisions until the core members are in place. Of course there will be decisions you cannot afford to delay, but it can be counterproductive to make decisions that commit new people to courses of action they had no part in defining. Carefully weigh the benefits of moving quickly on major initiatives against the lost opportunity of gaining buy-in from the people you will bring on board later. Trying to do it all yourself . Finally, keep in mind that restructuring a team is fraught with emotional, legal, and company policy complications. Do not try to undertake this on your own. Find out who can best advise you and help you chart a strategy. The support of a good HR person is indispensable to any effort to restructure a team. FIGURE 7-1 Synchronizing architectural alignment and team restructuring Assuming you avoid these traps, what do you need to do to build your team? Start by rigorously assessing the people you inherited, and then plan to evolve the team into what you need it to be. In parallel with this, work to align the team with your strategic direction and early-win priorities, and put in place the performance-management and decision-making processes you need to lead effectively. Assessing Your Team You likely will inherit some outstanding performers (A-players), some average ones (B-players), and some who are simply not up to the job (C-players). You will also inherit a group with its own internal === Page 103 === dynamics and politics; some members may even have hoped for your job. During your first 30 to 60 days (depending on the STARS mix you inherited), you need to sort out who’s who, what roles people have played, and how the group has worked in the past. Establish Your Evaluative Criteria You will inevitably find yourself forming impressions of team members as you meet them and digest results and performance reviews. Don’t suppress these early reactions, but be sure to step back from them and undertake a more rigorous evaluation. The starting point is to be conscious of the criteria you will explicitly or implicitly use to evaluate people who report to you.",

Does this team member bring the right kind of energy to the job, or is she burned out or disengaged? Focus .

Does this analysis accurately represent the values you apply when you evaluate people on your team? If so, does it suggest any potential blind spots in the way you evaluate people? It is worthwhile to spend some time thinking about the criteria you will use. Having done so, you will be better prepared to make a rigorous and systematic evaluation. Check Your Assumptions Your assessments are likely to reflect assumptions you hold about what you can and can’t change in the people who work for you. If you score relationships low and judgment high, for example, you may think that relationships within your team are something you can influence, whereas you cannot influence judgment. Likewise, you may have designated trust as a threshold issue—many leaders do— because you believe you must be able to trust those who work for you and because you think trustworthiness is a trait that cannot be changed. You may be right in these assumptions, but it’s essential that you be conscious you are making them. Factor In Functional Expertise",

This task can be daunting, especially for first-time enterprise leaders. If you’re an insider, try to solicit the opinions of people you respect in each function who know the individuals on your team. (For more on the transition to enterprise leadership and its challenges, see Michael Watkins, “How Managers Become Leaders,” Harvard Business Review , June 2012.) If you’re entering an enterprise leader role, consider developing your own templates for evaluating people in functions such as marketing, sales, finance, and operations. A good template includes function-specific key performance indicators (KPIs), what the KPIs should and should not show, key questions to ask, and warning signs. To develop each template, talk to experienced enterprise leaders about what they look for in these functions. Factor In the Extent of Teamwork The weights you apply in evaluation should vary depending on the work your direct reports are doing. Suppose, for example, that you’re taking a new job as vice president of sales, managing a geographically scattered group of regional sales managers. How would your criteria for evaluating === Page 105 === this group differ from those you would apply if you had been named to lead a new-product development project? These jobs differ sharply in the extent to which your direct reports operate independently. If your direct reports operate more or less independently, their capacity to work together will be far less important than if you were managing an interdependent product development team. In situations like this, it may be perfectly acceptable to have a high-performing group rather than a true team. Factor In the STARS Mix The criteria you apply may also depend on your STARS portfolio—the mix of start-up, turnaround, accelerated-growth, realignment, or sustaining-success situations you have inherited. In a sustaining- success situation, for example, you may have the time to develop one or two high-potential members of your team. It may be OK if they currently are B-players, if you are confident you can get them to the A-player level. 1 In a turnaround, by contrast, you need people who can perform at the A-player level right away. You also should evaluate people based on their STARS experience and capabilities as well as their match to the situation at hand. Suppose,",

Now you’ve been brought in to turn it around. You may have inherited people who would be A-performers in sustaining-success or realignment situations but who are not the types of leaders you need in a turnaround. Factor In the Criticality of Positions Finally, your evaluations of team members should depend on how critical their positions are. As you make your assessments, keep in mind it’s not only about players but also about positions. 2 So take some time to assess how important the various positions held by your direct and indirect reports are to your success. If it helps, list the positions and assess the criticality of each on a 1–10 scale. Then keep these assessments in mind as you evaluate the people you inherited. It’s important to do this, because it takes a lot of energy to make changes on your team. It may be all right if you find that you have a B-player in a position that isn’t high on the critical list, but not at all acceptable if the position is critical. Assess Your People When you begin to assess each team member using the criteria and assessments of position criticality you have developed, the first test is whether any of them fail to meet your threshold requirements. If so, begin planning to replace them. However, merely surviving the basic hurdle does not mean they are keepers. Go on to the next step: evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, factoring in the relative value you assign to each criterion. Now who makes the grade, and who does not? Meet one-on-one with each member of your new team as soon as possible. Depending on your style, these early meetings might take the form of informal discussions, formal reviews, or a combination, but your own preparation and focus should be standardized: 1 . Prepare for each meeting . Review available personnel history, performance data, and other === Page 106 === appraisals. Familiarize yourself with each person’s technical or professional skills so that you can assess how he functions on the team. 2 . Create an interview template . Ask people the same set of questions, and see how their answers vary. Here are sample questions. – What are the strengths and weaknesses of our existing strategy? – What are the",

In the medium term? – What resources could we leverage more effectively? – How could we improve the way the team works together? – If you were in my position, what would your priorities be? 3 . Look for verbal and nonverbal clues . Note choices of words, body language, and hot buttons. – Notice what the individual does not say. Does the person volunteer information, or do you have to extract it? Does the person take responsibility for problems in her area? Make excuses? Subtly point fingers at others? – How consistent are the individual’s facial expressions and body language with his words? – What topics elicit strong emotional responses? These hot buttons provide clues to what motivates the individual and what kinds of changes she would be energized by. – Outside these one-on-one meetings, notice how the individual relates to other team members. Do relations appear cordial and productive? Tense and competitive? Judgmental or reserved? Test Their Judgment Make sure you are assessing judgment and not only technical competence or basic intelligence. Some very bright people have lousy business judgment, and some people of average competence have extraordinary judgment. It is essential to be clear about the mix of knowledge and judgment you need from key people. One way to assess judgment is to work with a person for an extended time and observe whether he is able to (1) make sound predictions and (2) develop good strategies for avoiding problems. Both abilities draw on an individual’s mental models , or ways of identifying the essential features and dynamics of emerging situations and translating those insights into effective action. This is what expert judgment is all about. The problem, of course, is that you don’t have much time, and it can take a while to find out whether someone did or did not make good predictions. Fortunately, there are ways you can accelerate this process. One way is to test people’s judgment in a domain in which feedback on their predictions will emerge quickly. Experiment with the following approach. Ask individuals about a topic they’re passionate about outside work. It could be politics or cooking or baseball; it doesn’t matter. Challenge them to make predictions: “Who do you think is going to do better in the debate?” “What does it take to bake a perfect soufflé?” “Which team",

Then probe why they think their predictions are correct. Does the rationale make sense? If possible, follow up to see what happens. What you’re testing is a person’s capacity to exercise expert judgment in a particular domain. Someone who has become an expert in a private domain is likely to have done so in her chosen field of business, too, given enough passion about it. However you do it, the key is to find ways, beyond just waiting to see how people perform on the job, to probe for the hallmarks of expertise. Assess the Team as a Whole In addition to evaluating individual team members, assess how the entire group works. Use these techniques for spotting problems in the team’s overall dynamics: Study the data . Read reports and minutes of team meetings. If your organization conducts climate or morale surveys of individual units, examine these as well. Systematically ask questions . Assess the individual responses to the common set of questions you asked when you met with individual team members. Are their answers overly consistent? If so, this may suggest an agreed-on party line, but it could also mean that everyone genuinely shares the same impressions of what’s going on. It will be up to you to evaluate what you observe. Do the responses show little consistency? If so, the team may lack coherence. Probe group dynamics . Observe how the team interacts in your early meetings. Do you detect any alliances? Particular attitudes? Leadership roles? Who defers to whom on a given topic? When one person is speaking, do others roll their eyes or otherwise express disagreement or frustration? Pay attention to these signs to test your early insights and detect coalitions and conflicts. Evolving Your Team Once you’ve evaluated individual team members’ capabilities, factoring in functional expertise, teamwork requirements, the STARS portfolio, and the criticality of positions, the next step is to figure out how best to deal with each person. By the end of roughly the first 30 days, you should be able to provisionally assign people to one of the following categories: Keep in place . The person is performing well in her current job. Keep and develop . The individual needs development, and you have the",

The person is a strong performer but is not in a position that makes the most of his skills or personal qualities. Replace (low priority) . The person should be replaced, but the situation is not urgent. Replace (high priority) . The person should be replaced as soon as possible. === Page 108 === Observe for a while . This person is still a question mark, and you need to learn more before you can make a definitive judgment about them. These assessments need not be absolutely irreversible, but you should feel 90-plus percent confident in them. If you remain uncertain about someone, leave her in the “observe” category. As time goes on and you learn more, you can revise and refine your assessments. Consider Alternatives You may be tempted to begin right away to act on high-priority replacement decisions. But take a moment first to consider alternatives. Letting an employee go can be difficult and time-consuming. Even if poor performance is well documented, the termination process can take months or longer. If there is no paper trail regarding poor performance, it will take time to document. In addition, your ability to replace someone at all may depend on a host of factors, including legal protections, cultural norms, and political alliances. Sometimes it simply is not possible to replace someone, even if he is performing miserably. If this is the case, you must figure out how to play the hand you were dealt as well as possible. Fortunately, you have alternatives. Often, a poor performer will decide to move on of her own accord in response to a clear message from you. Alternatively, you can work with human resources to shift the person to a more suitable position: Shift her role . Move her to a position on the team that better suits her skills. This is unlikely to be a permanent solution for a problem performer, but it can help you work through the short- term problem of keeping the organization running while you look for the right person to fill the slot. Move her out of the way . If she simply can’t contribute productively or is a disruptive or dispiriting influence, then it is better to have her doing nothing than destroying value. Consider shrinking her responsibilities significantly. This also has the virtue of sending a",

Move her elsewhere in the organization . Help the person find a suitable position in the larger organization. Sometimes, if handled well, this move can benefit you, the individual, and the organization overall, but don’t pursue this solution unless you are genuinely convinced the person can perform well in the new situation. Simply shifting a problem performer onto someone else’s shoulders will damage your reputation. Develop Backups To keep your team functioning while you build the best possible long-term configuration, you may need to keep an underperformer on the job while searching for a replacement. As soon as you are reasonably sure that someone is not going to make it, begin looking discreetly for a successor. Evaluate other people on your team and elsewhere in the organization for the potential to move up. Use skip-level meetings and regular reporting sessions to evaluate the talent pool. Ask human === Page 109 === resources to launch a search. Treat People Respectfully During every phase of the team-evolution process, take pains to treat everyone with respect. Even if people in your unit agree that a particular person should be replaced, your reputation will suffer if they view your actions as unfair. Do what you can to show people the care with which you are assessing team members’ capabilities and the fit between jobs and individuals. Your direct reports will form lasting impressions of you based on how you manage this part of your job. Aligning Your Team Having the right people on the team is essential, but it’s not enough. To achieve your agreed-to priorities and secure early wins, you need to define how each team member can best support those key goals. This process calls for breaking down large goals into their components and working with your team to assign responsibility for each element. Then it calls for making each individual accountable for managing his goals. How do you encourage accountability? As illustrated in figure 7-2 , a blend of push and pull tools works best to align and motivate a team. Push tools , such as goals, performance measurement systems, and incentives, motivate people through authority, loyalty, fear, and expectation of reward for productive work. Pull tools , such as a compelling vision, inspire people by invoking a",

The mix of push and pull you use will depend on your assessment of how people on your team prefer to be motivated. Your high-energy go-getters may respond more enthusiastically to pull incentives. With more methodical and risk-averse folks, push tools may prove more effective. The right mix also will depend on the STARS situations you’re dealing with. Turnarounds typically provide plenty of push. The problem teaches people that something needs to be done. In realignment situations, however, it may be challenging to create a sense of urgency. When this is the case, focus more attention on the pull side of the equation—for example, by defining a compelling vision for what the organization could become. FIGURE 7-2 Using push and pull tools to motivate people Define Goals and Performance Metrics On the push side, establishing—and sticking to—clear and explicit performance metrics is the best way to encourage accountability. Select performance measures that will let you know as clearly as possible whether a team member has achieved her goals. === Page 110 === Avoid ambiguously defined goals, such as “Improve sales” or “Decrease product development time.” Instead, define goals in terms that can be quantified. Examples include “Increase sales of product X by 15 to 30 percent over the fourth quarter of this year,” or “Decrease development time on product line Y from twelve months to six months within the next two years.” Align Incentives A baseline question to ask yourself is how best to incentivize team members to achieve desired goals. What mix of monetary and nonmonetary rewards will you employ? It is equally important to decide whether to base rewards more on individual or collective performance. This decision is linked to your assessment of whether you need true teamwork. If so, put more emphasis on collective rewards. If it is sufficient to have a high-performing group, then place more emphasis on individual performance. It’s important to strike the right balance. If your direct reports work essentially independently and if the group’s success hinges chiefly on individual achievement, you don’t need to promote teamwork and should consider an individual incentive system. If success depends largely on cooperation among your direct reports and integration of their expertise, true teamwork is essential, and you should use group goals and incentives to gain alignment. Usually, you will want to create incentives for both individual excellence (when",

The correct mix depends on the relative importance of independent and interdependent activity for the overall success of your unit. (See box, “The Incentive Equation.”) The Incentive Equation The incentive equation defines the mix of incentives that you will use to motivate desired performance. Here are the basic formulas: The relative sizes of nonmonetary and monetary rewards depend on (1) the availability of nonmonetary rewards such as advancement and recognition and (2) their perceived importance to the people involved. The relative sizes of fixed and performance-based compensation depend on (1) the extent of observability and measurability of people’s contributions and (2) the time lag between performance and results. The lower the observability or measurability of contributions and the longer the time lag, the more you should rely on fixed compensation. The relative sizes of individual and group-based performance compensation depend on the extent of interdependence of contributions. If superior performance comes from the sum of independent efforts, then individual performance should be rewarded (for example, in a sales group). If group cooperation and integration are critical, then group-based incentives should get more weight (for example, in a new-product development team). Note that there may be several levels of group- based incentives: team, unit, and company as a whole. === Page 111 === Designing incentive systems is a challenge, but the dangers of incentive misalignment are great. You need your direct reports to act as agents for you, whether they’re undertaking individual responsibilities or collective ones. You don’t want to give them incentives to pursue individual goals when true teamwork is necessary, or vice versa. Articulate Your Vision When you’re aligning your team, don’t forget about the organization’s vision. After all, it’s a key reason why you and your team come to work every day. An inspiring vision has the following attributes: It taps into sources of inspiration. It is built on a foundation of intrinsic motivators, such as teamwork and contribution to society. One orthopedic medical device company, for example, had “Restoring the joy of motion” as its vision statement, accompanied by stories about injured athletes being able to compete again, and grandparents being able to hold their grandkids. It makes people part of “the story.” The best statements of vision connect people to a larger narrative that provides meaning—for example, a quest to recapture",

The vision must describe in graphic terms what the organization will achieve and how people will feel to have achieved it. Launching twelve rockets in ten years is a goal; putting a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth by the end of the decade, as President John F. Kennedy put it, is a vision. Use the categories in table 7-2 to help craft your shared vision. Keep asking yourself, Why should people feel inspired to expend extra effort to achieve the goals we have defined for the organization? TABLE 7-2 Inspirations for vision statements === Page 112 === As you work to create and communicate a shared vision, keep the following principles in mind: Use consultation to gain commitment . Be clear on which elements of your vision are nonnegotiable, but beyond these, be flexible enough to consider the ideas of others and allow them to have input and to influence the shared vision. In that way, they share ownership. Off- site meetings are often a powerful way to create and generate commitment to a shared vision, as long as you take care to ensure they are well designed. (See box, “Off-Site Planning Checklist.”) Develop stories and metaphors to communicate it . Stories and metaphors are potent ways to communicate the essence of a vision. There is something surprisingly powerful in a parable. The best of these stories crystallize core lessons and provide models for the kind of behavior you want to encourage. Reinforce it . Research on persuasive communication heavily underlines the power of repetition. Your vision is more likely to take root in people’s minds if it consists of a few core themes that are repeated until they sink in. Even when people have begun to understand the message, you should not stop. Strive constantly to deepen people’s commitment to the vision. Develop channels for communicating it . You cannot hope to communicate your vision directly to each person in your organization. This means that in addition to working with small groups such as a top team, you must be effective in persuading from a distance. This means developing communication channels that you will use to spread your vision more broadly. Finally, and above all, take care to live the vision you articulate. A vision that is undercut by inconsistent leadership behaviors—by you or members of",

Be sure you are prepared to walk the talk. === Page 113 === Off-Site Planning Checklist Before you schedule an off-site meeting for your new team, you need to clarify the reasons for doing so. What are you trying to accomplish with this meeting? There are at least six important reasons for having off-site meetings: To gain a shared understanding of the business (diagnostic focus) To define the vision and create a strategy (strategy focus) To change the way the team works together (team-process focus) To build or alter relationships in the group (relationship focus) To develop a plan and commit to achieving it (planning focus) To address conflicts and negotiate agreements (conflict-resolution focus) Getting Down to Details If you decide that an off-site meeting would indeed be useful for the group, start to consider the logistics of the meeting based on your answers to the following questions: When and where should the meeting be held? Which issues will be dealt with, and in what order? Who should act as facilitator? Don’t neglect the facilitation question. If you are a skilled facilitator and if the team respects you—and is not enmeshed in a conflict—it may make sense for you to be both leader and facilitator. If not, you’d be well advised to bring in a skilled outsider—either an expert on the substance of the issues you’re dealing with or a skilled orchestrator of team process. Avoiding the Traps Don’t try to do too much in a single off-site meeting. You can’t realistically accomplish more than two of the goals outlined earlier in a day or two. Target a few, and stay focused. Don’t put the cart before the horse. You can’t try to define the vision and create a strategy without first establishing the right foundation: a shared understanding of the business environment (diagnostic focus) and workplace relationships (relationship focus). Leading Your Team As you make progress in assessing, evolving, and aligning the team, think, too, about how you want to work with the team on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis. What processes will you use to shape how the team gets its collective job done? Teams vary strikingly in how they handle meetings, make decisions, resolve conflicts, and divide responsibilities and tasks. You will probably want to introduce new ways of doing things, but take care not to plunge into this task",

First, familiarize yourself thoroughly with how your team worked before your arrival and how effective its processes were. In that way, you can preserve what worked well and change what did not. Assess Your Team’s Existing Processes How can you quickly get a handle on your team’s existing processes? Talk to team members, peers, and your boss about how the team worked. Read meeting minutes and team reports. Probe for answers === Page 114 === to the following questions: Participants’ roles . Who exerted the most influence on key issues? Did anyone play devil’s advocate? Was there an innovator? Someone who avoided uncertainty? To whom did everyone else listen most attentively? Who was the peacemaker? The rabble-rouser? Team meetings . How often did your team meet? Who participated? Who set the agendas for meetings? Decision making . Who made what kinds of decisions? Who was consulted on decisions? Who was told after decisions were made? Leadership style . What leadership style did your predecessor prefer? That is, how did he prefer to learn, communicate, motivate, and handle decisions? How does your predecessor’s leadership style compare with yours? If your styles differ markedly, how will you address the likely impact of those differences on your team? Target Team Processes for Change Once you grasp how your team functioned in the past—and what did and did not work well—use what you learn to establish the new processes you judge necessary. Many leaders decide, for example, that their team’s meeting and decision-making processes would benefit from revision. If this is true of you, begin spelling out in specific terms what changes you envision. How often will the team meet? Who will attend which meetings? How will agendas be established and circulated? Setting up clear and effective processes will help your team coalesce and secure some early wins as a group. Alter the Participants One common team dysfunction—and a great opportunity to send a message that change is coming— concerns who participates in core team meetings. In some organizations, key meetings are too inclusive, with too many people participating in discussions and decision making. If this is the case, then reduce the size of the core group and streamline the meetings, sending the message that you value efficiency and focus. In other organizations, key meetings are too exclusive, with people who have potentially important opinions and information being systematically excluded. If this is",

Lead Decision Making Decision making is another fertile area for potential improvement. Few leaders do a great job of leading team decision making. In part, this is because different types of decisions call for different decision-making processes, but most team leaders stick with one approach. They do this because they have a style with which they are comfortable and because they believe they need to be consistent or risk confusing their direct reports. Research suggests that this view is wrongheaded. 3 The key is to have a framework for === Page 115 === understanding and communicating why different decisions will be approached in different ways. Think of the different ways teams can make decisions. Possible approaches can be arrayed on a spectrum ranging from unilateral decision making at one end to unanimous consent at the other. In unilateral decision making, the leader simply makes the call, either without consultation or with limited consultation with personal advisers. The risks associated with this approach are obvious: you may miss critical information and insights and get only lukewarm support for implementation. At the other extreme, processes that require unanimous consent from more than a few people tend to suffer from decision diffusion . They go on and on, never reaching closure. Or, if a decision does get made, it is often a lowest-common-denominator compromise. In either case, critical opportunities and threats are not addressed effectively. Between these two extremes are the decision-making processes that most leaders use: consult- and-decide and build consensus . When a leader solicits information and advice from direct reports —individually, as a group, or both—but reserves the right to make the final call, she is using a consult-and-decide approach. In effect she separates the “information gathering and analysis” process from the “evaluating and reaching closure” process, harnessing the group for one but not the other. In the build-consensus process, the leader both seeks information and analysis and seeks buy-in from the group for any decision. The goal is not full consensus but sufficient consensus. This means that a critical mass of the group believes the decision to be the right one and, critically, that the rest agree they can live with and support implementation of the decision. When should you choose one process over the",

Because even though you may reach a decision more quickly by the consult-and-decide route, you won’t necessarily reach the desired outcome faster. In fact, you may end up consuming a lot of time trying to sell the decision after the fact, or finding out that people are not energetically implementing it and having to pressure them. Those who suffer from the action imperative are most at risk of this; they want to reach closure by making the call but may jeopardize their end goals in the process. The following rules of thumb can help you figure out which decision-making process to use: If the decision is likely to be highly divisive—creating winners and losers—then you usually are better off using consult-and-decide and taking the heat. A build-consensus process will fail to reach a good outcome and will get everyone mad at one another in the process. Put another way, decisions about sharing losses or pain among a group of people are best made by the leader. If the decision requires energetic support for implementation from people whose performance you cannot adequately observe and control, then you usually are better off using a build- consensus process. You may get to a decision more quickly using consult-and-decide, but you may not get the desired outcome. If your team members are inexperienced, then you usually are better off relying more on consult-and-decide until you’ve taken the measure of the team and developed their capabilities. If you try to adopt a build-consensus approach with an inexperienced team, you risk getting frustrated and imposing a decision anyway, and that undercuts teamwork. === Page 116 === If you’re put in charge of a group with whom you need to establish your authority (such as supervising former peers), then you’re better off relying on consult-and-decide to make some key early decisions. You can relax and rely more on building consensus once people see that you have the steadiness and insight to make tough calls. Your approach to decision making will also vary depending on which of the STARS situations you’re in. In start-ups and turnarounds, consult-and-decide often works well. The problems tend to be technical (markets, products, technologies) rather than cultural and political. Also, people may be hungry for “strong” leadership, which often is associated with a consult-and-decide style. To",

These sorts of issues are typically best addressed with the build-consensus approach. To alter your approach to decision making depending on the nature of the decision to be made, you will sometimes have to restrain your natural inclinations. You are likely to have a preference for either consult-and-decide or build-consensus decision making. But preferences are not destiny. If you are a consult-and-decide person, you should consider experimenting with building (sufficient) consensus in suitable situations. If you are a build-consensus person, you should feel free to adopt a consult-and-decide approach when it is appropriate to do so. To avoid confusion, consider explaining to your direct reports what process you’re using and why. More importantly, strive to run a fair process. 4 Even if people do not agree with the final decision, they often will support it if they feel (1) that their views and interests have been heard and taken seriously and (2) that you have given them a plausible rationale for why you made the call you did. The corollary? Don’t engage in a charade of consensus building—an effort to build support for a decision already made. This rarely fools anyone, and it creates cynicism and undercuts implementation. You are better off to simply use consult-and-decide. Finally, you often can shift between build-consensus and consult-and-decide modes as you gain deeper insight into peoples’ interests and positions. It may make sense, for example, to begin in a consensus-building mode but reserve the right to shift to consult-and-decide if the process is becoming too divisive. It also may make sense to begin with consult-and-decide and shift to build- consensus if it emerges that energetic implementation is critical and consensus is possible. Adjust for Virtual Teams Finally, how should you modify your approach to building your team if some or all of the members are working remotely? It’s a big challenge to gain and sustain cohesion in virtual teams. It also makes it more difficult to evaluate team members, especially if the situation precludes early face-to-face meetings. Although most of the principles of effective teamwork apply to virtual teams, there are a few additional things to consider: Bring the team together early if at all possible . The technology to support virtual interactions is improving. However, if true teamwork",

This includes which communication channels will be used and how they will be employed. It also means having explicit agreements concerning responsiveness—for example, that urgent messages will be responded to within a specified time. Often it’s essential as well to have clear norms about how people will interact during virtual meetings—for example, interrupting less than usual when meeting face-to-face, but also being more efficient in putting points across. Clearly define team support roles . Virtual teams need to be more disciplined about capturing and sharing information as well as following up on commitments. It often helps to assign people specific team support roles (perhaps on a rotating basis), such as note-taker and agenda- creator. Create a rhythm for team interaction . Co-located teams naturally establish patterns and routines for interaction; these can be as simple as arriving at roughly the same time or talking over coffee. Virtual teams, especially those working in multiple time zones, lack natural opportunities to create these reassuring routines. Therefore, it’s essential to provide a lot of structure for virtual team interaction—for example, setting meeting times and following specified agendas. Don’t forget to celebrate success . It’s easy for members of a virtual team to feel disconnected, especially if most of the team is co-located and only a few are working remotely. Although it’s always important to pause occasionally to recognize and celebrate accomplishments, it’s essential in virtual teams. Jump-Starting the Team Your decisions about the team you inherited probably will be the most important decisions you make. Done well, your effort to assess, evolve, align, and lead the team will pay dividends in the focus and energy people bring to achieving goals and securing early wins. You will know you’ve been successful in building your team when you reach the break-even point—when the energy the team creates is greater than the energy you need to put into it. It will take a while before that happens; you must charge the battery before you can start the engine. BUILD YOUR TEAM—CHECKLIST 1 .

An accomplished sales and marketing professional, Alexia had risen through the country- management ranks of MedDev, a global medical devices company, to become the firm’s managing director (also informally known as “country manager”) in her native Russia. Senior leaders recognized Alexia’s potential and decided she needed broader regional experience. So they appointed her regional vice president of marketing for EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa). In this new role, Alexia was responsible for marketing strategy for MedDev’s country operations in the region. Alexia reported directly to Marjorie Aaron, the senior vice president of corporate marketing, who was based at the company’s U.S. headquarters, and Alexia had a dotted-line reporting relationship with her former boss, Harald Jaeger, the international vice president for EMEA operations, to whom all the managing directors in the region reported. Alexia dove in with her usual enthusiasm. She conducted a thorough review of current affairs, including one-on-one conversations with managing directors across the EMEA region and with her former boss. She also traveled to the United States expressly to meet with Marjorie and a couple of Marjorie’s direct reports. Drawing on those discussions, as well as her own experiences in the field, Alexia concluded that the most pressing problems—and opportunities—lay in better managing the tension between centralizing and decentralizing marketing decisions for new-product launches.

Marjorie and Harald saw merits in Alexia’s approach, but neither was prepared to commit. Both directed her to brief the key stakeholders: MedDev’s corporate marketing executives in the United States, and the EMEA country managers. Six weeks and many confounding meetings later, Alexia felt as if she was caught in quicksand. She had scheduled a meeting with important members of the corporate marketing team, including David Wallace, the executive reporting to Marjorie Aaron in charge of global branding. She then flew to the United States to present to a group of more than thirty people. Virtually every one of them had suggestions, all of which would result in more central control, not less. She was surprised, too, when a conference call with the EMEA country managers—her old === Page 120 === colleagues who reported to Harald Jaeger—didn’t go much better. They were more than happy to accept any ideas Alexia had that would give them additional flexibility. But when there was any mention of more limits to their autonomy, members of the group rapidly closed ranks. One respected managing director, Rolf Eiklid, expressed concern that the flexibility they were being offered wouldn’t be enough to compensate for what they would be giving up and that corporate wouldn’t really honor agreements. “We’ve been promised more flexibility in the past, and it hasn’t materialized,” he said. The usually sure-footed Alexia was thrown off her stride by this turn of events. She was left wondering whether she had the patience and finesse to navigate the politics of her new regional role. To succeed in your new role, you will need the support of people over whom you have no direct authority. You may have little or no relationship capital at the outset, especially if you’re onboarding into a new organization. So you will need to invest energy in building new networks. Start early. Discipline yourself to invest in building up “relationship bank accounts” with people you anticipate needing to work with later. Think hard about whether there are people you haven’t met who are likely to be critical to your success. Recognize, too, when a new role presents you with",

Alexia was used to operating with a lot of positional authority and a team that reported directly to her. She didn’t recognize early enough that she needed to influence in very different ways—through persuasion and alliance building—than she had in the past. Even if you have significant positional authority in your new role, however, you should focus on building support for your early-win objectives. This means figuring out whom you must influence, pinpointing who is likely to support (and who is likely to resist) your key initiatives, and persuading swing voters. Plans for doing this should be an integral part of your overall 90-day plan. Defining Your Influence Objectives The first step is to be clear about why you need the support of others. Start by thinking about the alliances you need to build in order to secure your early wins. For which of these wins will you need to gain the support of others over whom you have no (or insufficient) authority? Armed with a clear understanding of what you’re trying to accomplish, you can drill down and figure out whose support is essential and how you will secure it. Consider creating an alliance-building plan of each of your early-win projects. Alexia’s main goal was to negotiate a new deal (a “grand bargain”) between her new and old bosses and their respective organizations about the ways important marketing decisions would be made in EMEA. The status quo reflected a long-standing compromise between the two sides. It was an uneasy equilibrium, but more or less stable. And on the face of it, any changes were win-lose propositions. The corporate marketing organization naturally favored more centralization and standardization. The managing directors in the EMEA region wanted more local customization. The implication was that an agreement, if one could be found at all, would consist of a package of trades that both sides could support. To secure such an agreement, Alexia needed to build supportive alliances within both sides. It was unlikely she’d be able to achieve complete unanimity, because some people would have too === Page 121 === much invested in the status quo. So she should have focused instead on winning a critical mass of support for agreement in both the corporate and the regional organizations. Had Alexia understood this from the start, she might have focused her initial",

She would not have assumed that the strength of her business case would carry the day, nor would she have felt compelled to win over every single stakeholder. Instead, she should have identified the specific alliances she needed to build and then figured out how to exert the necessary influence in the organization. This process of mapping the influence landscape also might have helped her identify potential blockers: what or who might stand in the way of getting support for her direction? How could she get those in opposition to finally say yes? Understanding the Influence Landscape Armed with clarity on why you need to influence people, the next step is to identify who will be most important for your success. Who are the key decision makers? What do you need them to do, and when do you need them to do it? Table 8-1 provides a simple tool for capturing this information. Consider creating such a list for each early-win initiative you’re pursuing. TABLE 8-1 Identifying influential players Start to map your influence landscape by identifying influential players, what you need them to do, and when you need them to do it. Win and Block Alliances Next, for each of your early-win initiatives, ask yourself which decision makers are essential for things to move forward. Together, these people are your winning alliances —the set of people who collectively have the power to support your agenda. 1 Alexia, for instance, needed to secure approval for her proposals from Marjorie on the corporate side, and from Harald on the EMEA side. Together, they were the winning alliance Alexia needed to build. It also pays to think hard about potential blocking alliances —those who collectively have the power to say no. Who might band together to try to block your agenda, and why? How might they seek to impede the process? If you have a good sense of where opposition might come from, you can work === Page 122 === to neutralize it.

Formal authority is by no means the only source of power in organizations; people tend to defer to others’ opinions when it comes to important issues and decisions. Marjorie, for example, may defer to David’s assessment of the impact of increased local customization on brand identity. Likewise, Harald may defer to Rolf because he commands the respect of and represents his peers. Influence networks are channels for communication and persuasion that operate in parallel with the formal structure—a sort of shadow organization. 2 Sometimes these informal channels support what the formal organization is trying to do; at other times, they act to subvert it. To achieve her objective, Alexia needed to map networks of influence within corporate marketing, as well as with her old colleagues in the EMEA regional organization. How do you map influence networks? To a degree, they will become obvious as you get to know the organization—by, for example, working with your peers. But you can accelerate the process. One good way to start is by identifying the key points of contact between your organization and others. Customers and suppliers, within the business and outside, are natural focal points for alliance building. Another strategy is to get your boss to connect you to key stakeholders. Request a list of the key people outside your group whom he thinks you should get to know. Then set up early meetings with them. (In the spirit of the golden rule of transitions, consider proactively doing the same thing when you have new direct reports coming on board: create priority relationship lists for them, and help them make contact.) Take care, too, to observe carefully in meetings and other interactions to see who defers to whom on crucial issues. Notice whom people go to for advice and insight, and who shares what information and news. Who defers to whom when certain topics are being discussed? When an issue is raised, where do people’s eyes track? As you learn more, try to identify the sources of power that give particular people influence in the organization. Here are examples: Expertise Control of information Connections to others Access to resources, such as budgets and rewards Personal loyalty Over time, the patterns of influence will become clearer, and you’ll be able to identify those",

If you convince them, broader acceptance of your ideas is likely to follow. You will also begin to recognize the power coalitions : groups of people who explicitly or implicitly cooperate over the long term to pursue certain goals or protect certain privileges. Figuring out their agendas, and linking yours to them, can be a powerful way to build support, as long as you don’t end up watering down what you’re trying to do or get enmeshed in political machinations that could undercut you. Draw Influence Diagrams It can be instructive to summarize what you learn about patterns of influence by drawing an influence diagram like the one for Alexia’s situation shown in figure 8-1 . At the center circle are the critical decision makers—Marjorie in corporate marketing and Harald in EMEA operations. Alexia needed both to agree with the proposed package of changes, so they jointly constituted a winning alliance. However, as the arrows in the diagram indicate, these two executives would be influenced by people within their own organizations. (Heavier arrows denote a greater degree of influence.) Marjorie would be strongly influenced by David, her vice president of global branding, and Tim Marshall, vice president in the corporate strategy group. Harald would be influenced by the collective opinions of the country managers who report to him. But Rolf, the longtime managing director of the Nordic countries, would be highly influential both in shaping Harald’s views and in influencing the other managing directors. The diagram also shows that Alexia herself had significant influence on Harald and some on Marjorie. FIGURE 8-1 Alexia’s influence diagram This diagram illustrates the key influence relationships that will shape decision making on the issues Alexia Belenko is trying to address in her organization. === Page 124 === Identify Supporters, Opponents, and Persuadables The work you’ve done to map influence networks in your organization can also help you pinpoint potential supporters, opponents, and persuadables. To identify your potential supporters, look for the following: People who share your vision for the future. If you see a need for change, look for others who have pushed for similar changes in the past. People who have been quietly working for change on a small scale, such as a plant engineer who has found an innovative way",

Whatever supporters’ reasons for backing you, do not take their support for granted. It’s never enough merely to identify support; you must solidify and nurture it. So don’t forget to preach to the converted. Be sure, too, to ask supporters to be force multipliers by helping you influence others and by providing them with the most persuasive arguments for doing so. As you look for support, be sure to identify people with whom you could build alliances of convenience . There will be individuals with whom you disagree in many areas, but with whom you align on the specific issue of concern. If this is the case, think hard about how to educate and enlist them. Then there is the opposition. True adversaries will oppose you no matter what you do. They may believe you’re wrong in your assessments of the situation. Or they may have other reasons for resistance to your agenda: Comfort with the status quo. They resist changes that might undermine their positions or alter established relationships. Fear of looking incompetent. They fear seeming or feeling incompetent if they have trouble adapting to the changes you’re proposing and perform inadequately afterward. Threats to core values. They believe you’re promoting a culture that spurns traditional definitions of value or rewards inappropriate behavior. Threats to their power. They fear that the change you’re proposing (such as giving more decision rights to frontline managers) would deprive them of power. Negative consequences for their allies. They fear that your agenda will have negative consequences for others they care about or feel responsible for. But be careful not to assume that people are adversaries. When you meet resistance, probe for the reasons behind it before labeling people as implacably opposed. Understanding resisters’ motives many equip you to counter their arguments. For example, you may be able to address their fears of appearing incompetent in the new environment by helping them develop new skills. Keep in mind, too, that success in winning over adversaries can have a powerful, symbolic === Page 125 === impact. “The enemy who is converted to the ally” is a powerful story that will resonate with others in the organization. (Another example is the story of redemption—for example, helping a person who has been marginalized or labeled as ineffective",

There also will be people with whom you have good relationships and agree on many issues but who are not aligned with your specific agenda. These are a special class of opposition, and the key here is to find ways to preserve these relationships while still moving things in needed directions. See if you can do this by explaining what you need to do and why, by engaging in constructive problem-solving, and perhaps by finding ways to make up for their losses by helping them with other issues or returning the favor later. Finally, don’t forget about the persuadables —those people in the organization who are indifferent or undecided or uncommitted about your plans but who might be persuaded to throw their support your way if you can figure out how to influence them. Once you have identified them, figure out why they’re uncommitted. They may be: Indifferent. There may be many ways to get them to support your agenda in return for your support of theirs. Undecided. Find out why, and work to educate and persuade them. Political operators waiting to see which way the wind will blow. You need to convince them that things are going your way so that they climb on the bandwagon. Your assessment of support and opposition can be summarized in your influence map, as illustrated earlier in figure 8-1 . The darker circles indicate people who are opposed, light gray means they are supportive, and medium gray designates the undecided. (You also can use green-yellow-red color coding). On the corporate side in Alexia’s situation, Tim was supportive, whereas David was undecided. On the EMEA side, Rolf was somewhat opposed to Alexia’s proposed changes. Note that, once again, she had to win a critical mass of support on both sides for a deal to be struck. Understanding Pivotal People Now that you’ve analyzed the influence networks in your organization, identified the players and alliances, and mapped out support and opposition, the next step is to focus on the pivotal people you need to influence. In Alexia’s case, these were David and Rolf. Start by assessing their intrinsic motivators. People are motivated by various things, such as a need for recognition, for control, for power, for affiliation through relationships with colleagues, and for personal growth. 3 The relative weightings of these motivators can vary greatly. So take the time to figure out what",

If it is possible to engage them directly in dialogue, ask questions and engage in active listening. Seek especially to understand what potential opponents like Rolf are opposed to, and why. Given what motivates them, are there specific losses they’re trying to avoid? Is there something you can give them—a valuable trade—that might help compensate? Understanding people’s motivations is only part of the story. You also need to assess situational pressures : the driving and restraining forces acting on them because of the situation they’re in. === Page 126 === Driving forces push people in the direction you want them to go, and restraining forces are situational reasons they would say no. There is a lot of good social psychology research showing that we overestimate the impact of personality and underestimate the impact of situational pressures in reaching conclusions about the reasons people act the way they do. 4 Rolf’s opposition could be rooted in intrinsic inflexibility and a need to preserve his power and status, or he could be responding to situational pressures such as his business goals and incentives or the opinions of his peers (or a combination). So take the time to think about the forces acting on the people you want to influence. Then find ways to increase the drive and remove some restraints. Finally, think about how key people perceive their alternatives or choices. What are the options from which they believe they can choose? Critical here is to assess whether opponents like Rolf believe that resistance—overt or covert—can succeed in preserving the status quo. If so, then it could be important to convince them that the status quo is no longer a viable option. Once people perceive that change is going to happen, the game often shifts from outright opposition to a competition to influence what sort of change will occur. Could Alexia have convinced the key decision makers that the current situation was not acceptable, that change needed to take place? Concerns about the implementation of agreements also fall into this category. People may believe that concessions offered by others will not really materialize and that they are better off fighting for the status quo than taking a chance. This seems to be one concern that Rolf was voicing when he expressed worries about whether corporate would honor agreements to give the managing directors more flexibility. If worries",

For example, you might propose phasing in the changes, with each step linked to success in implementing the previous ones. TABLE 8-2 Analyzing motivations, driving and restraining forces, and alternatives Use this table to assess what motivates pivotal players, as well as the driving and restraining forces acting on them, and their perceptions of their alternatives (what choices they believe they have). Table 8-2 provides a simple tool for capturing information about motivations, driving and restraining forces, and perceptions of alternatives for pivotal people. Crafting Influence Strategies === Page 127 === Armed with deeper insight into the people you need to influence, you can think about how to apply classic influence techniques such as consultation, framing, choice-shaping, social influence, incrementalism, sequencing, and action-forcing events. Consultation promotes buy-in, and good consultation means engaging in active listening. You pose questions and encourage people to voice their real concerns, and then you summarize and feed back what you’ve heard. This approach signals that you’re paying attention and taking the conversation seriously. The power of active listening as a persuasive technique is vastly underrated. It can not only promote acceptance of difficult decisions but also channel people’s thinking and frame choices. Because the questions leaders ask and the ways they summarize responses have a powerful effect on people’s perceptions, active listening and framing are a potent persuasive technique. Framing means carefully crafting your persuasive arguments on a person-by-person basis. It’s well worth the time to get your framing right. Indeed, if Alexia can’t develop and communicate a compelling case in support of her proposed changes, nothing else she does will have much impact. Your messages should take an appropriate tone, resonate with the motivations of influential players and the forces acting on them, and, critically, shape how the key players perceive their alternatives. Alexia, for example, should have explored what it would take to move Rolf from being opposed to at least being neutral and, ideally, supportive. Did he have specific concerns that she could have addressed? Was there a set of trades that he would have found attractive if implementation could have been guaranteed? Were there ways of helping him advance other agendas he cared about in exchange for his support of Alexia’s approach? As you frame your arguments, keep in mind Aristotle’s",

Ethos is about elevating the principles that should be applied (such as fairness) and the values that must be upheld (such as a culture of teamwork) in making decisions. Pathos is about making powerful emotional connections with your audience—for example, putting forth an inspiring vision of what cooperation could accomplish. Effective framing focuses on a few core themes, which are repeated until they sink in. It is a sure sign of success when people begin to echo your themes without knowing they’re doing so. Focus and repetition are effective because we learn through repetition. By the third or fourth time we hear a song, we can’t get it out of our minds. It is possible, though, to hear a song so much that we get sick of it. Similarly, using precisely the same words over and over makes it apparent that you’re trying to persuade, and that can provoke a backlash. The art of effective communication is to repeat and elaborate core themes without sounding like a parrot. As you frame your arguments, think about how you can inoculate people against counterarguments you expect opponents to make. Presenting and decisively refuting weak forms of expected counterarguments immunizes audiences against the same arguments when they’re advanced in more potent forms. Table 8-3 provides a simple checklist for framing the types of arguments you need to make. TABLE 8-3 Framing arguments === Page 128 === Use the following categories and questions to identify the types of arguments you need to make to convince people. Choice-shaping is about influencing how people perceive their alternatives. Think hard about how to make it hard to say no. Sometimes choices are best posed broadly, at other times more narrowly. If you’re asking someone to support something that could be seen as setting an undesirable precedent, it might best be framed as a highly circumscribed, isolated situation independent of other decisions. Other choices might be better situated within the context of a higher-level set of issues. Selling choices perceived as win-lose propositions is particularly difficult. Broadening the range of issues or options under consideration can facilitate mutually beneficial trades that enlarge the pie. Progress likewise can be stalled by the presence of toxic issues. These sometimes can be neutralized",

Social influence is the impact of the opinions of others and the rules of the societies in which they live. The knowledge that a highly respected person already supports an initiative alters others’ assessments of its attractiveness. So convincing opinion leaders to make commitments of support and to mobilize their own networks can have a powerful leveraging effect. Likewise, research suggests that people prefer to operate in these ways: Remain consistent with strongly held values and beliefs. These values tend to be shared with important reference groups. People asked to engage in behavior inconsistent with their values or beliefs experience internal psychological dissonance. Remain consistent with their prior commitments and decisions. Failure to honor commitments tends to incur social sanctions, and inconsistency is a signal of unreliability. People prefer not to make choices that require them to reverse themselves or that overtly constrain their future choices by setting undesirable precedents. Repay obligations. Reciprocity is a strong social norm, and people are vulnerable to appeals for support that invoke past favors they’ve received. === Page 129 === Preserve their reputations. Choices that preserve or enhance one’s reputation are viewed favorably, whereas those that could jeopardize one’s reputation are viewed negatively. The implication is that you need to avoid, to the extent possible, asking others to make choices that are inconsistent with their values and prior commitments, decrease their status, threaten their reputations, or risk evoking the disapproval of respected others. If someone you need to influence has a competing prior commitment, you should look for ways to help them gracefully escape from it. Incrementalism refers to the notion that people can move in desired directions step-by-step when they wouldn’t go in a single leap. Mapping out a pathway from A to B is highly effective, because each small step taken creates a new psychological reference point for people in deciding whether to take the next one. For instance, Alexia could have started by meeting with people just to explore the centralization-versus-flexibility problem. Over time, however, the group could have analyzed each of the issues involved. And finally, after they had deliberately walked through all major concerns, the participants could have discussed basic principles for what a good solution might look like. Getting people involved in shared diagnosis of organizational problems is a form of incrementalism:",

Once there is agreement on the problem, you can shift to defining the options and then the criteria that will be used to evaluate them. By the end of such a process, people are often willing to accept outcomes they would never have accepted at the outset. Because incrementalism can have a powerful impact, it’s essential to influence decision making before momentum builds in the wrong direction. Decision-making processes are like rivers: big decisions draw on preliminary tributary processes that define the problem, identify alternatives, and establish criteria for evaluating costs and benefits. By the time the problem and the options have been defined, the actual choice may be a foregone conclusion. So remember that early success in shaping the process can have a big impact on the eventual outcome. Sequencing means being strategic about the order in which you seek to influence people to build momentum in desired directions. 6 If you approach the right people first, you can set in motion a virtuous cycle of alliance building. Success in gaining one respected ally makes it easier to recruit others—and your resource base increases. With broader support, the likelihood increases that your agenda will succeed, making it easier still to recruit more supporters. Based on her assessment of patterns of influence at MedDev, for example, Alexia definitely should have met first with corporate strategy VP Tim Marshall to solidify his support and arm him with additional information for persuading Marjorie. More generally, Alexia’s sequencing plan would consist of a well-thought-through series of one- on-one and group meetings to create the momentum for change. The critical point here is getting the mix right. One-on-one meetings are effective for getting the lay of the land—for instance, hearing people’s positions, shaping their views by providing new or extra information, or potentially negotiating side deals. But the participants in a serious negotiation often aren’t willing to make their final concessions and commitments unless they’re sitting face-to-face with others, and that is when group meetings are particularly effective. Action-forcing events get people to stop deferring decisions, delaying, and avoiding commitment of scarce resources. When your success requires the coordinated action of many people, delay by a === Page 130 === single individual can have a cascade effect, giving others an excuse not to proceed.

You do this by setting up action-forcing events—events that induce people to make commitments or take actions. Meetings, review sessions, teleconferences, and deadlines can all help create and sustain momentum: regular meetings to review progress, and tough questioning of those who fail to reach agreed-to goals, increase the psychological pressure to follow through.

The first hints of trouble in the new job were subtle. Every time he tried to get something done, Stephen felt as if he was wading through molasses. As a lifelong New Yorker accustomed to bluntness in talking about business, he found his new colleagues irritatingly polite and “nice.” Stephen complained to Irene that his colleagues refused to engage in hardheaded discussions about the tough issues. And he couldn’t find the kind of go-to people he had relied on to get things done in New York. Four weeks after Stephen started the job, Irene joined him in Toronto to look for a new house and school and to scope out prospects for continuing her freelance design work. Stephen was frustrated with the job and irritable. Irene’s unhappiness quickly mounted when she couldn’t find schools to her liking. The children had been happily enrolled in a top-tier private school in New York. They were displeased about moving and had been making Irene’s life miserable. She had calmed them with stories about the adventure of moving to a new country and promises to find them a great new school. Dispirited, she told Stephen she thought they should leave the kids where they were until the end of the year; he agreed. With Stephen commuting between Toronto and New York, and Irene under pressure as a working single parent, events quickly took their toll. Although Irene visited Toronto for a couple of weekends and continued looking into schools, it became clear that her heart was not in the move. Weekends often were stressful, with the children happy to see Stephen but unhappy about the move. Stephen often arrived back in the office on Mondays tired and found it hard to concentrate, aggravating his difficulties in getting traction and connecting with his colleagues and team. He knew his work performance was suffering, and that further increased his stress. Eventually he decided to force the issue. Through connections at the company, he found a good school and identified some promising housing prospects. But when he pressed Irene to get going on selling their apartment, the result was the worst fight of their marriage. When it became clear their === Page 132 === relationship was being jeopardized, Stephen told the firm he needed either to",

The uncertainty and ambiguity can be crippling. You don’t know what you don’t know. You haven’t had a chance to build a support network. If you’ve moved, as Stephen did, you’re also in transition personally. If you have a family, they, too, are in transition. Amid all this turmoil, you’re expected to get acclimated quickly and begin to effect positive change in your new organization. For all these reasons, managing yourself is a key transition challenge. Are you focusing on the right things in the right way? Are you maintaining your energy and keeping your perspective? Are you and your family getting the support you need? Don’t try to go it alone. Taking Stock A good place to start is to take stock of how you’re feeling about how things are going in your transition right now. So take a few minutes to look at the “Guidelines for Structured Reflection” (see box) to assess how you’re doing. Guidelines for Structured Reflection How Do You Feel So Far? On a scale of high to low, do you feel: Excited? If not, why not? What can you do about it? Confident? If not, why not? What can you do about it? In control of your success? If not, why not? What can you do about it? What Has Bothered You So Far? With whom have you failed to connect? Why? Of the meetings you’ve attended, which has been the most troubling? Why? Of all that you’ve seen or heard, what has disturbed you most? Why? What Has Gone Well or Poorly? Which interactions would you handle differently if you could? Which exceeded your expectations? Why? Which of your decisions have turned out particularly well? Not so well? Why? What missed opportunities do you regret most? Was a better result blocked primarily by you, or by something beyond your control? Now focus on the biggest challenges or difficulties you face. Be honest with yourself. Are your difficulties situational, or do their sources lie within you? Even experienced and skilled people may blame problems on the situation rather than on their own actions. The net effect is that they are less proactive than they could be. === Page 133 === Now take a step back. If things are not going",

Is it only the inevitable emotional roller coaster you will experience when taking a new role? It’s inevitable that your initial enthusiasm will wane as the excitement of taking on a new challenge wears off and the reality sets in of the challenges you face. It’s common for leaders to go into a valley three to six months after taking a new role. The good news is that you’re virtually certain to come out the other side—as long as you’re applying your 90-day plan, of course. It’s also possible, however, that the difficulties you face are the result of deeper personal vulnerabilities that could take you offtrack. That’s because transitions tend to amplify your weaknesses. So look at the following list of potentially dysfunctional behaviors, and ask yourself (and, if it’s safe to do so, others who know you well and will give you honest feedback) whether you potentially are suffering from any of these syndromes. Undefended boundaries. If you fail to establish solid boundaries defining what you are willing and not willing to do, the people around you—bosses, peers, and direct reports—will take whatever you have to give. The more you give, the less they will respect you and the more they will ask of you—another vicious cycle. Eventually you will feel angry and resentful that you’re being nibbled to death, but you will have no one to blame but yourself. If you cannot establish boundaries for yourself, you cannot expect others to do it for you. Brittleness. The uncertainty inherent in transitions can exacerbate rigidity and defensiveness, especially in new leaders with a high need for control. Often the result is overcommitment to failing courses of action. You make a call prematurely and then feel unable to back away from it without losing credibility. The longer you wait, the harder it is to admit you were wrong, and the more calamitous the consequences. Or perhaps you decide that your way of accomplishing a particular goal is the only way. As a result, your rigidity disempowers people who have equally valid ideas about how to achieve the same goal. Isolation. To be effective, you must be connected to the people who make action happen and to the subterranean flow of information. It’s surprisingly easy for new leaders to end up isolated, and isolation can creep up on you. It happens because",

It also happens if you unintentionally discourage people from sharing critical information with you. Perhaps they fear your reaction to bad news, or they see you as having been captured by competing interests. Whatever the reason, isolation breeds uninformed decision making, which damages your credibility and further reinforces your isolation. Work avoidance. You will have to make tough calls early in your new job. Perhaps you must make major decisions about the direction of the business based on incomplete information. Or perhaps your personnel decisions will have a profound impact on people’s lives. Consciously or unconsciously, you may choose to delay by burying yourself in other work or fool yourself into believing that the time isn’t ripe to make the call. The result is what leadership thinkers have termed work avoidance : the tendency to avoid taking the bull by the horns, which results in tough problems becoming even tougher. 1 === Page 134 === All these syndromes can contribute to dangerous levels of stress. Not all stress is bad. In fact, there is a well-documented relationship between stress and performance known as the Yerkes- Dodson curve, illustrated in figure 9-1 . 2 Whether stress is self-generated or externally imposed, you need some stress (often in the form of positive incentives or consequences from inaction) to be productive. Without it, not much happens—you stay in bed munching chocolates. FIGURE 9-1 Yerkes-Dodson human performance curve As you begin to experience pressure, your performance improves, at least at first. Eventually you reach a point (which varies from person to person) at which further demands, in the form of too many balls to juggle or too heavy an emotional load, start to undermine your performance. This dynamic creates more stress, further reducing your performance and creating a vicious cycle as you go over the top of your stress curve. Rarely, exhaustion sets in and you burn out. Much more common is chronic underperformance: you work harder and achieve less. This is what happened to Stephen. Understanding the Three Pillars of Self-Management If you have these sorts of weaknesses, what can you do about it? You must vigorously engage in self- management, a personal practice that is built on a foundation with three pillars. The first pillar is adoption of the success",

The third pillar is formation of support systems, at work and at home, that help you maintain your balance. Pillar 1: Adopt 90-Day Strategies The strategies spelled out in the previous eight chapters represent a template for how to prepare, learn, set priorities, create plans, and direct action to build momentum. When you see these strategies work and when you get some early successes under your belt, you will feel more confident and energized by what you’re accomplishing. As you progress through your transition, think about the challenges you’re facing in light of the core challenges summarized in table 9-1 , and identify the chapters to which you want to return. === Page 135 === TABLE 9-1 Assessment of core challenges Core challenge Diagnostic questions Prepare yourself. Are you adopting the right mind-set for your new job and letting go of the past? Accelerate your learning. Are you figuring out what you need to learn, whom to learn it from, and how to speed up the learning process? Match your strategy to the situation. Are you diagnosing the type of transition you face and the implications for what to do and what not to do? Negotiate success. Are you building your relationship with your new boss, managing expectations, and marshaling the resources you need? Secure early wins. Are you focusing on the vital priorities that will advance your long-term goals and build your short-term momentum? Achieve alignment. Are you identifying and fixing frustrating misalignments of strategy, structure, systems, and skills? Build your team. Are you assessing, restructuring, and aligning your team to leverage what you’re trying to accomplish? Create alliances. Are you building a base of internal and external support for your initiatives so that you’re not pushing rocks uphill? Pillar 2: Develop Personal Disciplines Knowing what you should be doing is not the same thing as doing it. Ultimately, success or failure emerges from the accumulation of daily choices that propel you in productive directions or push you off a cliff. This is the territory of the second pillar of personal efficacy: personal disciplines. Personal disciplines are the regular routines you enforce on yourself ruthlessly. What specific disciplines are the highest priorities for you? It depends on what your strengths and weaknesses are. You may have a great deal of insight",

(Some 360-degree feedback can be useful here.) What do they see as your strengths and, crucially, your potential weak spots? Use the following list of personal disciplines to stimulate your thinking about routines you need to develop. Plan to Plan. Do you devote time daily and weekly to a plan-work-evaluate cycle? If not, or if you do so irregularly, you need to be more disciplined about planning. At the end of each day, spend ten minutes evaluating how well you met your goals and then planning for the next day. Do the same thing at the end of each week. Get into the habit of doing this. Even if you fall behind, you will be more in control. Focus on the Important. Do you devote time each day to the most important work that needs to be done? It’s easy for the urgent to crowd out the important. You get caught up in the flow of transactions === Page 136 === —phone calls, meetings, e-mail—and never find time to focus on the medium term, let alone the long term. If you’re having trouble getting the real work done, discipline yourself to set aside a particular time each day, even as little as half an hour, when you will close the door, turn off your phone, ignore e-mail, and focus, focus, focus. Judiciously Defer Commitment. Do you make commitments on the spur of the moment and later regret them? Do you blithely agree to do things in the seemingly remote future, only to kick yourself when the day arrives and your schedule is full? If you do, you must learn to defer commitment. Whenever anybody asks you to do something, say, “Sounds interesting. Let me think about it and get back to you.” Never say yes on the spot. If you’re being pressed (perhaps by someone who knows your vulnerability to such pressure), say, “Well, if you need an answer now, I’ll have to say no. But if you can wait, I will give it more thought.” Begin with no; it’s easy to say yes later. It’s difficult (and damaging to your reputation) to say yes and then change your mind. Keep in mind that people will ask you to make commitments far in advance, knowing that your schedule will look deceptively open. Go to",

If you do, discipline yourself to stand back, take stock from fifty thousand feet, and then make productive interventions. Leading authorities in the fields of leadership and negotiation have long praised the value of “going to the balcony” in this way. 3 It can be tough to do this, especially when the stakes are high and you’re emotionally involved. But with discipline and practice, it is a skill that can be cultivated. Check In with Yourself. Are you as aware as you need to be of your reactions to events during your transition? If not, discipline yourself to engage in structured reflection about your situation. For some new leaders, structured self-assessment means jotting down a few thoughts, impressions, and questions at the end of each day. For others, it means setting aside time each week to assess how things are going. Find an approach that suits your style, and discipline yourself to use it regularly. Work to translate the resulting insights into action. Recognize When to Quit. To adapt an old saw, transitions are marathons and not sprints. If you find yourself going over the top of your stress curve more than occasionally, you must discipline yourself to know when to quit. This is easy to say and hard to do, of course, especially when you’re up against a deadline and think one more hour might make all the difference. It may, in the short term, but the long-term cost could be steep. Work hard at recognizing when you’re at the point of diminishing returns, and take a break of whatever sort refreshes you. Pillar 3: Build Your Support Systems The third pillar of self-management is solidifying your personal support systems. This means asserting control in your local environment, stabilizing the home front, and building a solid advice- and-counsel network. === Page 137 === Assert Control Locally. It’s hard to focus on work if the basic infrastructure that supports you is not in place. Even if you have more pressing worries, move quickly to get your new office set up, develop routines, clarify expectations with your assistant, and so on. If necessary, assemble a set of temporary resources to tide you over until the permanent systems are operational. Stabilize the Home Front. It’s a fundamental rule of warfare to avoid fighting on too many",

You cannot hope to create value at work if you’re destroying value at home. This is the fundamental mistake that Stephen made. If your new position involves relocation, your family is also in transition. Like Irene, your spouse may be making a job transition, too, and your children may have to leave their friends and change schools. In other words, the fabric of your family’s life may be disrupted just when you most need support and stability. The stresses of your professional transition can amplify the strain of your family’s transition. Also, family members’ difficulties can add to your already heavy emotional load, undermining your ability to create value and lengthening the time it takes for you to reach the break- even point. So focus on accelerating the family transition, too. The starting point is to acknowledge that your family may be unhappy, even resentful, about the transition. There is no avoiding disruption, but it can be helpful to talk about it and work through the sense of loss together. Beyond that, here are some guidelines that can help smooth your family’s transition: Analyze your family’s existing support system. Moving severs your ties with the people who provide essential services for your family: doctors, lawyers, dentists, babysitters, tutors, coaches, and more. Do a support-system inventory, identify priorities, and invest in finding replacements quickly. Get your spouse back on track. Your spouse may quit his old job with the intention of finding a new one after relocating. Unhappiness can fester if the search is slow. To accelerate it, negotiate up front with your company for job-search support, or find such support shortly after moving. Above all, don’t let your spouse defer getting going. Time the family move carefully. For children, it is substantially more difficult to move in the middle of a school year. Consider waiting until the end of the school year to move your family. The price, of course, is separation from your loved ones and the wear and tear of commuting. If you do this, however, be sure that your spouse has extra support to help ease the burden. Being a single parent is hard work. Preserve the familiar. Reestablish familiar family rituals as quickly as possible, and maintain them throughout the transition. Help from favorite relatives, such",

If you move internationally, get professional advice about the cross-cultural transition. Isolation is a far greater risk for your family if there are language and cultural barriers. === Page 138 === Tap into your company’s relocation service, if it has one, as soon as possible. Corporate relocation services are typically limited to helping you find a new home, move belongings, and locate schools, but such help can make a big difference. There is no avoiding pain if you decide to move your family. But there is much you can do to minimize it and to accelerate everyone’s transitions. Build Your Advice-and-Counsel Network. No leader, no matter how capable and energetic, can do it all. You need a network of trusted advisers within and outside the organization with whom to talk through what you’re experiencing. Your network is an indispensable resource that can help you avoid becoming isolated and losing perspective. As a starting point, you need to cultivate three types of advisers: technical advisers, cultural interpreters, and political counselors (see table 9-2 ). You also need to think hard about the mix of internal and external advisers you want to cultivate. Insiders know the organization, its culture and politics. Seek out people who are well connected and whom you can trust to help you grasp what is really going on. They are a priceless resource. TABLE 9-2 Types of advisers At the same time, insiders cannot be expected to give you dispassionate or disinterested views of events. Thus, you should augment your internal network with outside advisers and counselors who === Page 139 === will help you work through the issues and decisions you face. They should be skilled at listening and asking questions, have good insight into the way organizations work, and have your best interests at heart. Use table 9-3 to assess your advice-and-counsel network. Analyze each person in terms of the domains in which she assists you—technical adviser, cultural interpreter, political counselor—as well as whether each is an insider or an outsider. Now take a step back. Will your existing network provide the support you need in your new role? Don’t assume that people who have been helpful in the past will continue to be helpful in your new situation. You will encounter different problems, and former advisers may not be able to help you in your",

As you attain higher levels of responsibility, for example, the need for good political counsel typically increases dramatically. TABLE 9-3 Assessment of your advice-and-counsel network You should also be thinking ahead. Because it takes time to develop an effective network, it’s not too early to focus on what sort of network you will need in your next job. How will your needs for advice change? To develop an effective support network, you need to make sure you have the right help and your support network is there when you need it. Does your support network have the following qualities? The right mix of technical advisers, cultural interpreters, and political counselors. The right mix of internal and external advisers. You want honest feedback from insiders and the dispassionate perspective of outside observers. External supporters who are loyal to you as an individual, not to your new organization or unit. Typically, these are long-standing colleagues and friends. Internal advisers who are trustworthy, whose personal agendas don’t conflict with yours, and who offer straight and accurate advice. Representatives of key constituencies who can help you understand their perspectives. You do not want to restrict yourself to one or two points of view. Staying on Track === Page 140 === You will have to fight to manage yourself every single day. Ultimately, your success or failure will flow from all the small choices you make along the way.

It was written to help them diagnose their situations, define the core challenges, and design plans to create momentum. Hundreds of thousands of leaders have benefited from the approach, which independent research has shown reduces time to break-even by as much as 40 percent. 1 When a new leader fails to thrive, it’s a severe, perhaps career-ending, blow to the individual. But what about the impact of transitions on companies? Every failed transition—whether outright derailment or less dramatic underperformance—exacts costs from the organization as well. The magnitude of these costs is such that a state-of-the-art transition acceleration system (hereafter “acceleration system”) can reduce enterprise risk, create competitive advantage, and speed up change implementation. Think first about the risks posed by senior executive transitions, both onboarding of new hires and internal promotions. A single failure at the senior executive level can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in direct costs, never mind lost opportunities or damage to businesses. The independent study of the Genesis Advisers program and coaching processes mentioned previously yielded an assessed 1,400 percent ROI based on conservative salary assumptions. But beyond that, the following verbatim quotations from the study highlight the scope and dimensions of the potential impact of derailment or underperformance. 2 “In one business, under a struggling new leader, growth slowed by half in one region. When you look at the after-tax impact, that amounted to $7 to 8 M U.S.” “Initiatives were not undertaken, and results were not met. A new product launch was delayed. When new product development problems arise, the impact of a poor transition could be $100 M U.S.” “A key cost is loss of talent. There is a huge cost that goes beyond direct dollars. Hi- potentials are a scarce resource, and we’re tough on them. If they don’t make it, you’ve washed out a hi-potential.” Companies typically have systems in place to assess and manage other risks of comparable magnitude, and they should manage executive transition risk with equal rigor. An acceleration system is therefore an element of overall enterprise risk management. Now consider the cumulative impact on performance of the many ongoing transitions occurring at all levels. Recall that about a quarter of all the leaders in typical Fortune 500 companies change",

Executives have even higher annual rates of transition—35 percent in the top three tiers of leadership in one study, with 22 percent moving internally and 13 percent being hired from the outside. And each transition materially impacts the performance of about a dozen people surrounding the leader—peers, direct reports, and bosses. Imagine the value of accelerating all those transitions by only 10 percent, never mind 40 percent. Success in accelerating everyone contributes directly to improving company performance. It’s even a potential source of competitive advantage; if you can help everyone get up to speed faster, the business will be more nimble and responsive. An acceleration system is therefore a key element of a high-performance organization. Finally, think about what happens when your business goes through a significant change event—a restructuring, a phase of rapid growth, or integration of an acquisition. Every major change creates a ripple of individual transitions that cascades through the organization. The important “hard side” work of getting in place the right structure and systems and staffing the key positions is only the first phase of change implementation. To achieve planned objectives, such as acquisition synergy targets, strategic direction must be driven down through the organization; clarity about roles, responsibilities, and decision rights must be established; and relationship building must be accelerated. The 90-day framework described in this book has been applied very successfully to accelerate the second phase of organizational change in Rapid Rewire implementations. The focus typically is on team acceleration, and it begins with the top team and flows down through the organization. Teams at every level use the same methodology, language, and tools to create 90-day plans and build relationships and teamwork. Success in applying this approach can make the difference between achieving targets and failing miserably. That’s because, as many companies have learned painfully, the soft side of change is the hard side. An acceleration system is therefore an essential element of the organizational change management toolkit. Whether the focus is on risk management, performance improvement, change implementation, or all three, companies have a big stake in accelerating transitions at every level—internally and externally, individually and organizationally. This means that they should manage leadership- transition acceleration as they would any critical business process—by putting in place the right framework, tools, and systems to accelerate everyone. Given this, how should companies approach the design of acceleration",

Identify the Critical Transitions The starting point is to understand how many transitions are occurring in your organization and to focus first on accelerating the most important of them. It’s surprising how many companies are unable to answer basic questions about the number of people who are being hired, getting promoted, moving between units, and making lateral moves. Without good data on the frequency of transitions—and, critically, without awareness of when they are occurring—it’s difficult to design acceleration systems. You need to understand transition frequencies in order to assess the costs and benefits of providing support at different levels and to efficiently allocate resources. Suppose, for example, that === Page 143 === you anticipate a relatively high frequency of movement (greater than 30 percent) at the frontline leader level, perhaps because the business is growing rapidly. It’s a good rule of thumb that leaders at this level should participate in transition workshops (in person or virtually) within their first 60 days on the job (in addition, as described later, to getting immediate launch resources at the time they move into their new roles). These workshops tend to work best with fifteen to twenty participants. You can use this information to plan where and when transition support will be offered. Beyond knowing transition frequencies, it’s valuable to know what the mix is of onboarding, inboarding (moves between units), promotion, and lateral moves. Knowing this allows you to tailor the support you’re providing. That’s because, as described later, support should be customized somewhat to the types of transitions leaders are experiencing. Then you need to focus on critical transitions. Which are the most important transitions going on in your company? Suppose you’re a small, rapidly growing pharmaceutical company. You have just received approval for a promising new drug; you’re hiring a new sales force and need to get up to speed faster than a competitor. Your success in onboarding new salespeople may make the difference between great success and so-so performance. Your initial efforts therefore should focus on helping all those salespeople get up to speed as quickly as possible, as well as helping the sales organization as a whole to gel. Use the Transition Heat Map tool in figure 10-1 to summarize your assessments of which transitions are most critical in your organization. FIGURE",

Start by listing the key organizational units or groups or projects in the left-hand column. Then identify any major change events that are occurring in each of these units, groups, projects. Finally assess the relative intensity of key types of transitions—onboarding, promotion, geographic moves, and lateral moves—that are occurring in each organization. The result is a summary that you can use to communicate about priorities. Identify Set-Up-to-Fail Dynamics As discussed in the introduction, there are common traps new leaders fall into. Examples include staying in your comfort zone or trying to do too much too fast. These can largely be avoided through implementation of acceleration systems based on the principles discussed in this book. However, there also are systematic mistakes that organizations make when putting leaders into new roles that need to be addressed in the design of acceleration systems. 3 Respondents to the HBR/IMD study highlighted classic ways that companies set up their leaders to fail. Reasons for unnecessary derailment or underperformance are summarized in table 10-1 . === Page 144 === There is not much point in putting in place acceleration systems if your company is setting up leaders to fail in these ways. The implication is that you may need to address culture change as part of your broader effort to put a system in place. Suppose your company does a poor job of sizing the leaps that leaders are being asked to make. If it is, you may want to push for systematic use of the transition risk assessment discussed in the introduction. Likewise, if there are widespread problems with providing clarity about expectations, they can be addressed through disciplined use of the five conversations discussed in chapter 4 . Diagnose Existing Transition Support Companies often have a patchwork quilt of existing systems for supporting transitions. One unit may do a good job of promoting lower-level leaders, another has an effective executive onboarding system, and yet another does a good job of supporting international moves. Because the benefits of having a companywide acceleration system based on a common core framework are great, however, this mosaic of existing systems usually needs to be modified substantially or even replaced.

To do this assessment, follow these guidelines: Identify and assess the status of your company’s existing acceleration support frameworks and tools. What approaches have been used, and why? To what degree do they represent best practice? Examine the approaches (coaching programs, virtual workshops, self-guided materials) your organization currently uses to deliver transition support at all levels of the leadership pipeline. Evaluate the associated costs and benefits. Assess the overall coherence of your organization’s approach to supporting different types of transitions—onboarding, promotion, and lateral and international moves. Is there a common core model for accelerating all transitions? Identify the key stakeholders (bosses, peers, direct reports, HR generalists, learning and development personnel) who do or could provide support during transitions. === Page 146 === Assess the adequacy of your company’s HR information systems (for example, websites) in directly supporting transitions and in providing the data about where and when transitions are occurring, so that you can provide support on a just-in-time basis. Adopt a Common Core Model Given the frequency with which people take on new jobs and the impact of each transition on others, it makes sense to have everyone—bosses, direct reports, and peers—employ the same common core model to support transition. The foundation of an acceleration system is a unified, companywide framework, language, and toolkit for talking about and planning transitions. This probably is the single most important step your organization can take to build an acceleration system. Imagine that every leader in transition were able to converse with bosses, peers, and direct reports about the following: The STARS portfolio of challenges they had inherited—the mix of start-up, turnaround, accelerated growth, realignment, or sustaining success—and the associated challenges and opportunities Their technical, cultural, and political learning and the key elements of their learning plan Their progress in the five conversations—situation, expectations, style, resources, and progress—with their boss and direct reports Their agreed-upon priorities and plans for where they will secure early wins The alliances they need to build A common core model makes discussions of these issues dramatically more efficient. Perhaps more importantly, it means that conversations will happen that wouldn’t have happened otherwise. It also makes people more forthcoming, more likely to share confidences and information, and more tolerant of others’ transition struggles.",

Deliver Support Just in Time Transitions evolve through a series of predictable stages. New leaders begin their transitions with intensive diagnostic work. As they learn and gain increasing clarity about the situation, they shift to defining strategic direction (mission, goals, strategy, and vision) for their organizations. As the intended direction becomes clearer, they are better able to make decisions about key organizational issues—structure, processes, talent, and team. In tandem, they can identify opportunities to secure early wins and begin to drive the process of change. The type of support that new leaders need, therefore, shifts in predictable ways as the transition process unfolds. Early on, support for accelerating learning—technical, cultural, and political—is key. As the leader’s understanding grows, the focus of support should shift to helping him define === Page 147 === strategic direction, lay the foundation for success, secure early wins, and so on. Critically, leaders need to be offered transition support in digestible blocks. Once they are in their new roles, they are rapidly immersed in the flow of events and can devote only very limited time to learning, reflecting, and planning. If support is not delivered just in time, the new leader is not likely to use it. A corollary is to leverage the time before entry to the maximum extent possible. Transitions begin with recruiting or selection, and not when leaders formally enter their new positions. This is a priceless period when new leaders can begin to learn about their organizations and plan their early days on the job. Acceleration systems should therefore be designed to help new leaders get the maximum possible benefit from whatever preentry time is available to them. This means supporting new leaders’ learning processes by providing them with key documents and tools that help them plan their early diagnostic activities, as well as helping them connect with key stakeholders as early as possible. For executives, it may be beneficial to have transition coaches engage in preentry diagnosis, including interviews with key stakeholders, and distill this knowledge into an actionable assessment that provides the basis for early discussions. Use Structured Processes The paradox of transition acceleration is that leaders in transition often feel too busy to learn and plan their transitions. They know they should be tapping into available resources and devoting time to planning their transitions, but the",

Although it helps to leverage the time before entry and to provide just-in-time support, transition processes also need to have action-forcing events. These include preset coaching meetings at each stage of the process or scheduled cohort events that take leaders out of the fray to engage in reflection and create or refine their 90-day plans. The implication is that transition support should not be designed as a free-flowing process in which the leader sets the pace. It’s better to create a series of focused events—coach meetings or cohort sessions—at critical stages. After undertaking preentry diagnosis of the situation and helping the leader engage in self-assessment, for example, the coach and client are well positioned to have a highly productive launch meeting to jump-start the process. When transition coaching is provided, it’s critical that the new leader and the coach connect early on in a focused and engaged way. One reason it can be beneficial for coaches to engage in intensive preentry diagnosis is that they have a precious resource—knowledge about the situation—that they can convey to the new leader. Their insight, offered in the critical early phases of the transition, can help cement the coach-client relationship. Match Support to Transition Type The 90-day framework and toolkit can be applied in all types of transition situations. However, the === Page 148 === importance of different activities—for example, focusing more or less attention on learning about the culture—varies significantly, depending on the types of transitions leaders are experiencing. Therefore, it’s often helpful to identify the most important types of transitions the company needs to support and to develop specific, targeted supplemental resources to support them. In particular, there often are good reasons to provide new leaders with additional resources for dealing with two common types of transitions: Promotion. As discussed in chapter 1 , when leaders are promoted they face a predictable set of challenges. The competencies required to be successful at the new level may be quite different from the skills that made them successful at their previous level. They also may be expected to play different roles, exhibit different behaviors, and engage with direct reports in different ways. So focused sets of resources should be provided that help newly promoted leaders understand what success looks like at the new level, assess themselves, and create a personal development",

Likewise, when leaders join new organizations or move between units with distinct subcultures, they face major challenges in aligning expectations, adapting to new cultures, and building the right sorts of relationships. Focused, accessible resources for helping them understand what it takes to get things done and assistance in identifying and connecting with key stakeholders can help reduce derailment and can speed time to high performance. Match Transition Support to Leader Level If cost were not an issue, every transitioning leader would get intensive, highly personalized support. In an ideal world, a new leader would be assigned a transition coach who would undertake an independent diagnosis and brief the person on the results before entry. The coach would help the leader engage in self-assessment and identify key transition risk factors. The coach also would help support diagnostic planning and goal setting, assist with team assessment and alignment, gather feedback on how the leader was doing, and, of course, be available to the new leader as needed to talk through specific issues. Because the impact of executives on the business is great, it often makes sense to provide them with transition coaching. (If you do, be sure to understand that transition coaching is very different from development coaching. See the box, “Transition Coaching and Developmental Coaching.”) But it typically doesn’t make economic sense to provide it to leaders at lower levels. The solution is threefold. First, identify alternative modes for delivering transition support (for example, coaching versus cohort sessions versus virtual workshops and self-guided materials). Second, assess the relative costs and benefits of the support, and third, match its delivery mode and extent to key levels in the company’s leadership pipeline in order to maximize the return on investment. === Page 149 === Transition Coaching and Developmental Coaching Transition coaching is very different from developmental coaching. It’s essential that transition coaches have the business acumen necessary to act as trusted advisers to leaders in transition. In addition, a thorough knowledge of the organization and its culture is a prerequisite for effectiveness. For this reason, it can be dangerous for newly hired leaders to bring in their own coaches, as they may lack experience with transitions as well as an understanding of the culture and political system the leader is entering.

Key players may include bosses, peers, direct reports, HR generalists, coaches, and mentors. Although primary responsibility for supporting a transition may be vested with one individual—typically a coach or HR generalist—it is important to think through the supportive roles that others could play and to identify ways to encourage them to do so. A boss, for example, has an obvious stake in getting the new leader up to speed quickly but also may be dealing with other pressing demands. Careful thought must be given to providing bosses and other key players with guidelines and tools that allow them to be highly focused and efficient in supporting their new direct reports. HR generalists likewise can provide invaluable support to leaders who are onboarding by helping them navigate the new culture. But once again, they both need to know what to do and have incentives to do it. Integrate with Other Talent Management Systems === Page 150 === Acceleration systems work best when they’re linked with the company’s recruiting and leadership development systems. This need for integration seems obvious on the face of it, because the best onboarding systems can’t compensate for the sins of poor recruiting. If the company hires people who aren’t likely to fit with the culture, then little can be done to reduce the risk of derailment through onboarding. It’s surprising, therefore, that many companies still do not do a good job of integrating recruiting and onboarding. Often, people in these functions report up through different parts of the organization and are led by people with different, perhaps even divergent, goals, measures of success, and incentives. A necessary first step is to have them under the same organizational umbrella and align their goals and incentives. Beyond that, the company should think about transition risk when it engages in recruiting. Doing so means, as illustrated in figure 10-2 , making transition risk tolerance part of the process of setting up searches. Often, businesses practice “best athlete” recruiting—hiring people because they have a needed set of capabilities and not paying enough attention to fit. It’s fine to take a significant risk in bringing in someone from a very different culture, as long as you have been thoughtful about the trade- offs between individual capabilities and cultural fit, and as long as transition risk is",

Of course, doing this requires the company to have a good understanding of its culture and the reasons people might struggle to assimilate. This understanding can be refined, as illustrated in the figure, by feedback from successes and failures in onboarding. FIGURE 10-2 Linking recruiting and onboarding There also is great value in feeding information about potential risks from recruiting to the onboarding process. Recruiting typically involves multiple forms of assessment, including psychometric instruments and in-depth interviews. The instruments can provide transition coaches and workshop facilitators with valuable insight into leaders’ styles and ways they might struggle in adapting to the culture. Interviews likewise can provide rich information about likely transition risks, as long as interviewers are explicitly asked to make assessments and develop a transition risk profile for new hires. Then there is the relationship between leadership development systems and transition acceleration systems. Leadership development systems prepare talent to go to the next level. Transition acceleration systems should help them make the leap. Although this description makes the two seem === Page 151 === distinct, in reality there are opportunities for connecting development and acceleration. One example is including familiarization with the organization’s core transition acceleration model in development programs. Doing so helps leaders take on a transition state of mind and think about how they will enter their next roles when the time comes. It also provides a foundation on which to build during the transition, a foundation that is valuable given the high demands that new leaders typically experience. A second example is strengthening leadership development by assessing leaders’ experience with different types of transitions using the STARS model. This model provides a basis for charting the progression of high-potential leaders through a series of positions that build their capability to manage a broad range of business situations. It also identifies potential development gaps—for example, that a leader has mostly managed turnarounds and needs to be channeled into experiences that provide exposure to a broader range of business situations. To illustrate, think of your own job history. Take time to fill out the development grid, a tool for charting professional development shown in table 10-3 . TABLE 10-3 The development grid The rows represent functions in which you have worked, and the columns represent types of business situations you have experienced.

For example, if your first job was in marketing in an organization (or unit) in the midst of a turnaround, place a circled 1 (indicating your first management position) in the corresponding cell of the matrix. If your next position was in sales in a new unit (or dealing with a new product or project)—a start-up situation—enter a circled 2 in that cell. If at the same time you were on a task force dealing with operations issues for the start-up, enter a 2 inside a triangle (indicating a project assignment) in the appropriate cell. Record all your jobs, and then connect the dots to illuminate your professional trajectory. Are there any blank columns or rows? What do they signify about your readiness for new positions? About your potential blind spots? Putting It All Together Given the many transitions that occur in organizations and the substantial impact they have, it makes sense to evaluate the costs and benefits of designing and deploying companywide acceleration === Page 152 === systems. Best-in-class systems are founded on a core transition acceleration framework and toolkit, provide support just in time, are customized to some degree for types of transitions, and are deployed in cost-effective ways throughout the organization. They also take the organizational context into account by aligning and incentivizing key stakeholders and by linking to recruiting and leadership development systems. ACCELERATE EVERYONE—CHECKLIST 1 . What are the most important transitions in your organization, and how often do they occur? 2 . Is the organization able to identify where and when transitions are occurring? 3 . Is there a common core transition acceleration framework, language, and toolkit? 4 . Do leaders have the support they need, when they need it, and throughout their transitions? What could be done to provide focused resources for onboarding and promotion transitions? 5 . Are the company’s systems for recruiting and accelerating transitions linked in appropriate ways? 6 . Should transition acceleration be part of your organization’s curriculum for developing high- potential leaders? 7 . How might the 90-day framework be used to accelerate organizational change—for example, restructuring or post-acquisition integration? === Page 153 === NOTES PREFACE 1 .

For each individual who transitions, there also are many others—direct reports, bosses, and peers—whose performance is negatively affected. In a 2009 survey of company presidents and CEOs, I asked for their best estimate of the number of people whose performance was significantly compromised by the arrival of a new midlevel manager. The average of the responses was 12.4 people. 5 . My survey conducted in 2000 of senior HR executives at Fortune 500 companies, results previously reported in the first edition of The First 90 Days . === Page 154 === 6 . This research was conducted by two clients—a Fortune 100 health-care company and a Fortune 500 financial services company —of Genesis Advisers programs and coaching. Both used subjective estimates of improved performance and estimated ROI based on conservative salary cost criteria. The 2006 study by the global health-care company focused on 125 participants in transition programs or coaching. Program participants reported an average 38 percent improvement in performance, and coached executives reported an average 40 percent improvement. The estimated return on investment was 1,400 percent. The financial services company study conducted in 2008 focused on assessing acceleration in time to break-even for 50 participants in a First 90 Days program. Participants reported an average 1.2-month decrease in time to break-even. ROI for the program was calculated to be roughly 300 percent based on salary costs only. 7 .
