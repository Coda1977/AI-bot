Being a manager is as easy as riding a bike. Except the bike is on fire, you're on fire, everything is on fire, and you're in hell.



That manager having a bad day? They got one thing right.



Management isn't a promotion. It's a career change. The skills that made you great at your job? They're now mostly irrelevant. Your technical excellence, your ability to crush spreadsheets or write beautiful code—none of that matters if your team delivers mediocre results.



Here's your new reality: You are responsible for the work of your direct team.



Not responsible for doing the work. Responsible for the work getting done, and done well.



Some new managers try to hack this by taking on all the important work themselves. They become the hero developer who codes all night. The hero marketer who writes every campaign. The hero salesperson who closes every deal.



It's understandable. It's also unsustainable. And it's not management—it's just doing your old job with a fancier title and more meetings.



Your actual job breaks down into two parts:



1\. Make the work productive: Create goals that matter. Rebuild broken processes. Invent tools that multiply output. This is the "hard" stuff everyone thinks management is about.



2\. Make the worker achieving: Give clear direction. Coach through problems. Build relationships that create trust. Deliver feedback that actually changes behavior. This is the "soft" stuff that's actually harder.



If someone on your team is mediocre, you did a mediocre job helping them learn. If your team has a reputation for missing deadlines, you have a reputation for missing deadlines. If they fail, you fail.



The whole game is getting work done through other people, not over them or under them.

**author vs. editor**



In every conversation between a manager and an employee, someone sits in the Author seat and someone sits in the Editor seat.



Both seats must be filled. The question is: which one are you sitting in?



The Two Seats



The Author does the actual work. They take ownership, show initiative, display critical thinking, and create solutions. They Author.



The Editor doesn't do the work. They set expectations for what they're looking for, and when the Author presents their work, the Editor makes it better. They Edit.



Here's how to spot the difference:



Your struggling employees want YOU in the Author seat. They come to you saying, "There's a problem, what should I do?"



They want you to Author the solution so when things go wrong, they can say, "I just did what you told me."



Your best employees? They Author.



They come saying, "Here's the problem, here are three options I'm considering, and here's my recommendation."



The Trap



As a manager, if you're not requiring your direct reports to bring something for you to Edit, you're Authoring their work. You're not helping them improve their ability to think independently.



Every time you solve their problem instead of helping them solve it, you create dependency. They get weaker. You get busier. Everyone loses.



Think about it: When someone brings you a problem and you immediately start solving it, who's doing the thinking? Who's learning? Who's growing?



Not them.



How to Stay in Editor Mode



Never accept an empty page.



Employee: "We have a problem with the Johnson account."



You (Author mode): "Here's what we should do..."



You (Editor mode): "What are your thoughts on how to handle it?"



Edit, don't rewrite.



Even if their solution is 60% right, work with that 60%. Help them see what's missing. Ask questions that reveal gaps. Don't throw away their work and start over.



Make them defend their thinking.











"What other options did you consider?"







"What are the risks of this approach?"







"How would you handle it if X happened?"







"Why did you rule out Y?"



These questions build their judgment, not just their execution.



The Dependency Test



Count how many times in your next team meeting you Author versus Edit.



If you're Authoring more than 20% of the time, you're training your team to bring you problems, not solutions. You're teaching them that thinking is your job, not theirs.







Try This Week



Pick your most dependent team member—the one who constantly asks, "What should I do?"



Next time they come with a problem, stop them:



"I need you to come back with three possible solutions and your recommendation. Think through the pros and cons of each. We'll meet tomorrow at 2pm to review your thinking."



They'll be uncomfortable. Good. They'll say they don't know enough. Don't cave.



"Use your best judgment with what you know. I'd rather review your imperfect solutions than create them from scratch."



Their first attempt will be rough. Their second will be better. By the third time, they'll stop needing you for everything.



That's the point. You're not building solutions. You're building problem-solvers.



**accountability**





Expectations are just resentments under construction.



You expect people to "know" what good looks like because they've "been here long enough" or "it's common sense." Then you're shocked and angry when they miss the mark.



Every time you launch a new project without crystal-clear expectations, you're building future resentment. Theirs and yours.



The Three-Part Clarity Conversation



Before any major project or responsibility, have this exact conversation:



1\. What's at stake?



"Here's what this means for our customers/team/company, and why it matters now."



Don't assume they see the bigger picture. Paint it for them. When people understand the "why," they make better decisions about the "how."



2\. Why you?



"I chose you for this because of your \[specific skill/experience/perspective]."



This isn't flattery. It's clarity. When people know why they were chosen, they lean into those strengths. When they don't know, they wonder if they're just the only one available.



3\. What does success look like?



"Here's precisely what needs to be delivered, by when, and how I'll measure success."



Vague: "Improve customer satisfaction"



Clear: "Reduce response time to under 2 hours for 90% of tickets by March 1st"



Skip any part of this conversation and you've set up failure.



The Accountability Ladder



Watch where people operate on any given project:



Perpetuating - They make problems worse. They create drama, spread negativity, or actively sabotage.



Observing - They watch problems unfold from the sidelines. "Yeah, I saw that coming" but did nothing.



Advising - They tell others how to fix problems while staying safely uninvolved. All talk, no action.



Solving - They get into problems and fix them. They own outcomes, not just activities.



Most people hover between Observing and Advising. They see the fire, they might even point at it and describe it eloquently, but they don't grab the extinguisher.



The Direct Conversation



When someone's not taking accountability, don't create elaborate systems or hope they'll figure it out. Have the conversation:



"On this project, I'm seeing you give advice about what should happen, but I need you to actually make it happen. When you see a problem, I need you to own it—not just flag it. Can you make that shift?"



Focus on the specific project, not their character. We all show different accountability levels depending on the work, the stakes, and our confidence.



The Ownership Test



Ask yourself: If this project fails spectacularly, who would feel personally responsible? Who would lose sleep? Who would feel like they failed?



If the answer isn't the person running it, you haven't delegated accountability—just tasks.



Tasks without accountability is just creating busy work. Accountability without clarity is just creating anxiety.







Try This Week



Take your most important project that's struggling. Have the three-part clarity conversation with whoever owns it:



1\. Remind them what's at stake (make it real, make it matter)



2\. Tell them specifically why you believe they can fix it



3\. Get crystal clear about what success looks like by Friday



Then ask directly: "Are you ready to own this completely, or do we need to find someone who will?"



If they hesitate, dig deeper. What support do they need? What authority are they missing? What's making them reluctant to own it?



But don't let the conversation end without clear ownership. Shared accountability is no accountability.



**Performance standards**



Bill Walsh took over the worst team in the NFL—the 1979 San Francisco 49ers. They'd won 2 games the previous season. Total disaster.



Three years later, they won the Super Bowl. Then another. Then another.



How? Walsh ignored the scoreboard.



While other coaches obsessed over winning, Walsh obsessed over how his players carried themselves. How they practiced. How they dressed. How they spoke to media. Even how they sat on the plane.



He called it the "Standard of Performance"—the idea that champions don't focus on winning. They focus on the behaviors that predict winning.



The Absolute vs. The Relative



Winning is relative. It depends on your opponent, the conditions, the referee, luck. You can play perfectly and lose. You can play terribly and win.



But a standard of performance is absolute. It's entirely in your control.



It's the difference between:



\- "Beat our competitors" (depends on them)



\- "Respond to leads within 2 hours" (depends only on you)



Walsh discovered something profound: Quality outcomes are the natural byproduct of quality processes.



Focus on the process, results follow. Focus only on results, both deteriorate.



From Wishes to Standards



Most managers set "standards" like:



\- Provide excellent customer service



\- Show initiative



\- Be professional



\- Communicate well



These aren't standards. They're wishes. Hopes. Prayers.



Real standards are observable and binary. You either did them or didn't.



The Hotel That Gets It



A five-star hotel chain doesn't tell staff to "be friendly." They have specific standards:



The 15-10-5 Rule:



\- At 15 feet: Focus your attention on any guest



\- At 10 feet: Smile and make eye contact



\- At 5 feet: Verbally greet them



Plus:



\- Never tell a guest what you can't do—only what you can do



\- Never let a guest do something for themselves that you could do for them



\- Treat anyone who walks in as a VIP



An average hotel hopes their staff will be friendly. This hotel has engineered friendliness into specific, repeatable actions.



Guess which one has better reviews?



The Diet Principle



Want to lose weight? You could focus on the scale (outcome) or you could focus on behaviors (process):



\- Don't consume white—flour, sugar, milk



\- Eat as many vegetables as you want



\- Stop eating at 8pm



\- Use smaller plates



Do the behaviors consistently, weight loss follows. Obsess over the scale without changing behaviors, nothing happens except frustration.



Your team works the same way.



Finding Your Standards



Study your highest performers. Not their results—their behaviors. What do they actually DO differently?



Your best salespeople might:



\- Send follow-up emails within 2 hours



\- Always include three options in proposals



\- Call clients quarterly even without news



Your best engineers might:



\- Comment code while writing it



\- Test edge cases before being asked



\- Document decisions in pull requests



These become your standards. Not "be a good salesperson" but "follow up within 2 hours."



The Enforcement Reality



Walsh tracked everything. Jersey tucked in? Check.



Arrived 10 minutes early? Check.



His philosophy: If players couldn't meet small standards, they'd fail at big ones under pressure.



You don't need Walsh's military precision, but you need some tracking. Pick 3-5 behaviors that matter most. Make them visible. Celebrate when people nail them. Address immediately when they don't.



Standards without reinforcement are just suggestions.







Try This Week



1\. Pick one critical process for your team (client communication, code reviews, meeting management—whatever drives your success)



2\. Define what excellence looks like in 3-5 specific, observable behaviors:



\- Not "good communication" but "respond within 4 hours"



\- Not "quality code" but "zero console errors, 80% test coverage"



\- Not "effective meetings" but "agenda sent 24 hours prior"



3\. Share with your team: "This is what excellence looks like. Every time."



4\. Track the behaviors for one week. Not outcomes—behaviors.



Don't track whether projects succeeded. Track whether people followed the standards. The success will follow.



Remember: The scoreboard takes care of itself when the standards are clear.



**growth mindset**





Are you a "know it all" or a "learn it all"?



That's the question Satya Nadella asks Microsoft employees. It's also the question that predicts whether you and your team will adapt or become obsolete.



Know-it-alls believe talent is fixed. You're either good at something or you're not. They're the ones who say, "I'm just not a numbers person" or "She's a natural presenter."



When they fail, they quit. When they succeed, they coast.



Learn-it-alls believe talent comes through effort and new strategies.



When they fail, they ask: "What can I try differently?"



When they succeed, they ask: "What's next?"



Here's the thing: We all think we're learn-it-alls. But watch what happens when you struggle with something new. Do you push through and try different approaches?



Or do you make excuses about how "that's not my strength"?



The Myth of Effort



Everyone misunderstands growth mindset. They think it's about trying harder. That's dead wrong.



Growth mindset = Effort + Learning = New Strategies



Working harder at the same failing approach isn't growth mindset. It's insanity.



Think about kids playing soccer. The old way: medals for scoring goals. The new way: participation medals just for showing up. Both miss the point.



In a growth mindset world, you'd give medals for kids who learn new moves. The kid who couldn't kick with their left foot and now can. The kid who learned to pass backward to create space. The kid who figured out three ways to defend against faster opponents.



It's not about effort. It's not about results. It's about acquiring new strategies.



The Fixed Mindset Trap



Listen to your team's language:











"I'm just not good at presentations"







"He's naturally talented at coding"







"I've always done it this way"







"Some people are just born leaders"







"That's not really my thing"



This is fixed mindset.



It's also Abraham Maslow's "aborted self-actualization"—deliberately planning to be less than you're capable of being.



Maslow put it brutally: "If you deliberately plan to be less than you are capable of being, then I warn you that you'll be deeply unhappy for the rest of your life. You will be evading your own capacities, your own possibilities."



Your team members are aborting their potential every time they say "I'm not good at that" instead of "I haven't learned that yet."



Creating Growth Mindset in Your Team



1\. Mine the Learning from Mistakes



Don't just say "it's a learning experience" and move on. That's empty. Use the simplest learning cycle:











What? What actually happened? (Facts only, no interpretation)







So what? Why did it happen that way? (Root cause, not blame)







Now what? What will we do differently? (New strategy, not "try harder")



If you skip the "now what," you're just having a feelings circle, not learning.



2\. Replace Performance Reviews with Learning Reviews



Instead of "How are the numbers?" ask "What new approaches have you tried this month?"



Instead of "You missed your target" say "Your current strategy isn't working. What are three different approaches you could test?"



Make learning the metric, not just results.



3\. Prep People for Hard Feedback



Before giving criticism, say: "I'm about to share something that might sting, but it's because I see potential you're not using. Ready?"



This frames feedback as growth, not judgment. It's the difference between "You're bad at this" and "You haven't learned this yet."



4\. Celebrate Strategy Changes, Not Just Wins



"I love that you tried building the presentation backward from the key decision. What made you think of that approach?"



"You completely changed how you run discovery calls. Walk me through what you learned."



When you celebrate new strategies, you get more of them. When you only celebrate results, you get people stuck doing the same thing harder.







Try This Week



Find someone who's excellent at something you struggle with. Could be a peer, could be from another team, could be from YouTube.



Ask them (or observe): "What exactly do you DO that makes this work?"



Don't ask for tips or advice. Ask for their specific strategy—the actual steps they take, the exact words they use, the framework they follow.



Then try their approach exactly as they do it. Not your modified version. Their version.



That discomfort you feel copying someone else's approach? That's not embarrassment. That's learning. That's what growth mindset actually feels like.



Remember: Your team is full of know-it-alls pretending to be learn-it-alls. Show them the difference by learning something new yourself.



**Delegation**

How many monkeys are on your back right now?



Here's a typical five-second conversation:







Team Member: "Boss, we have a problem with the deployment."



You: "Yeah, I heard. Let me look into it."



What just happened?



You adopted a monkey. That problem jumped from their back to yours in five seconds. The employee feels relieved. You feel responsible. The monkey is happy on its new back.



Each monkey takes 5-30 minutes to solve. If you have ten monkeys, that's five hours. If each of your five team members gives you two monkeys a week, that's a whole day gone.



Check your email, Slack, texts right now. Count the monkeys—the problems that started on someone else's desk and somehow became yours.



Getting Rid of Monkeys



These are the four steps to push a monkey back where it belongs:



1\. Describe the monkey



Don't let the conversation end until you've identified specific next steps. What exactly needs to happen? By when? By whom?



2\. Assign the monkey



The monkey belongs at the right level. Usually, that's not you. If your team member found the problem, they probably should own solving it.



3\. Insure the monkey



Give them one of two insurance policies:



\- Recommend, then act: They propose a solution, you approve, they execute



\- Act, then advise: They solve it and tell you what they did



Pick based on risk and their experience. But pick one.



4\. Check on the monkey



Schedule follow-ups at specific intervals.



Not "keep me posted" but "let's review Friday at 2pm."



From Partial to Full Delegation



Getting rid of monkeys is just partial delegation—pushing tasks back down. But you need full delegation—giving away entire responsibilities.



Partial delegation: "Create this report for me"



Full delegation: "Own all customer reporting"



To figure out what to fully delegate, do this:



1\. Write down everything you do. Everything. From the strategic to the mundane.



2\. Sort into three buckets:



\- Do: Only you can do this



\- Delete: Adds no value, stop doing it



\- Delegate: Someone else could own this



3\. If your "Delegate" list is empty, you're not developing anyone.



The Delegation Conversation That Works



Most delegation fails because of unclear expectations. Here's the template that prevents that:



1\. Explain the full responsibility



"You now own all customer success metrics and reporting."



2\. Define success clearly



"Success means executives never call me asking what the numbers mean. They get what they need from your reports."



3\. Clarify your oversight level



Break down the key activities and your monitoring:



\- Budget planning: "I'll review quarterly" (low trust currently)



\- Weekly reports: "You run them, I'll spot-check monthly" (medium trust)



\- Team coordination: "You handle it, flag problems only" (high trust)



Be transparent: "I'm watching budget closely because it's new for you. My goal is to give you full autonomy within six months."



The Trust Progression



Don't pretend you trust completely when you don't. That leads to micromanaging disguised as delegation.



Instead, be clear: "I trust your team coordination completely—you've done it successfully before. Budget planning is new, so we'll work closely on that at first."



This isn't insulting. It's honest. And it gives them a clear path to full autonomy.







Try This Week



1\. List three problems currently on your desk that started on someone else's



2\. Pick the biggest one. Have this conversation with whoever should own it:



\- "This problem needs to be solved by Friday"



\- "Come back with three possible solutions and your recommendation"



\- "We'll review at \[specific time], then you'll implement"



\- "I'm here if you hit a genuine roadblock, but try to solve it first"



3\. For longer-term delegation, pick one recurring responsibility that takes you 30+ minutes weekly. Find someone who could learn it. Have the full delegation conversation using the template above.



Then actually let go. Don't secretly redo their work. Don't hover. Check at the agreed times only.



Remember: Every monkey on your back is a growth opportunity stolen from someone else.



**Total Motivation**

What really drives performance? McKinsey studied it. Google studied it. Microsoft obsessed over it.



Lindsay McGregor and Neel Doshi cracked the code in their research for "Primed to Perform."



They found six motivators that predict both tactical performance (following process) and adaptive performance (solving new problems).



The first three boost performance. The last three kill it.



The Performance Drivers



Play



The work itself is enjoyable. Not ping-pong tables in the office—the actual work fascinates them. Developers who love elegant code. Salespeople who love the hunt. Designers who lose themselves in pixels.



Purpose



They believe in the outcome. They see how their work matters. The nurse who sees patients heal. The teacher who sees students grow. The engineer whose code makes life easier for millions.



Potential



The work helps them become who they want to be. It's a stepping stone to their bigger goals. The analyst learning skills for their startup. The manager building toward executive leadership.



These three predict both excellent execution and creative problem-solving.



The Performance Killers



Emotional Pressure



Fear, guilt, shame, or peer pressure drives them. They work to avoid disappointment, criticism, or letting people down. "I can't fail in front of everyone."



Economic Pressure



They're only here for money or to avoid punishment. Work is purely transactional. "I do exactly what keeps my job, nothing more."



Inertia



They work because... that's what they've always done. No active choice, just momentum. "I show up, time passes, I go home."



These three destroy creativity first, then engagement, then eventually basic execution.



The Reality Check



You can't pay people enough to care. You can't scare them into innovation. You can't guilt them into going above and beyond.



But you can tap into what actually drives them.



The best companies have 2-3x more Play, Purpose, and Potential than average companies. The worst companies run on Emotional Pressure, Economic Pressure, and Inertia.



Which one is your team?



The Stay Interview tool



Don't wait for exit interviews to learn what drives your best people. Do stay interviews now.



Schedule 30 minutes with a top performer and ask:



1\. "What are your top 4 reasons for staying?"



Let them think. The real reasons often come third or fourth.



2\. "Who here makes work better for you?"



This reveals relationship motivators you might not see.



3\. "Where do you see your work having impact?"



This uncovers their sense of purpose—or lack of it.



4\. "If you could redesign your role, what would change?"



This shows where potential is blocked.



5\. "If you managed yourself, what would you do differently?"



This is where they tell you what they really need.



Then—and this is critical—actually do something with the answers. Otherwise, you just accelerated their departure.



Power Recognition tool



Every Thursday, ask yourself:



1\. What great result did we achieve this week?



2\. Who drove it?



3\. What exactly did they do?



Then tell them. Not "great job"—tell them specifically:



"Your presentation landed the Johnson account because you anticipated their three biggest objections and addressed them before they asked. That preparation strategy is rare. Where else could you apply it?"



This isn't feel-good fluff. You're programming behavior. What gets recognized gets repeated.



The key is catching the strategy, not just the result. Results can be lucky. Strategies can be replicated.



The Motivation Audit



For each team member, assess their primary drivers:



High Play: Give them interesting problems, not just urgent ones



High Purpose: Connect their work to customer impact constantly



High Potential: Show them the path to where they want to go



High Emotional Pressure: Reduce fear, increase safety



High Economic Pressure: Add meaning beyond the paycheck



High Inertia: Shake things up, change their routine



You can't change people's core motivation overnight. But you can shift the mix gradually.

Part 1: Pick your highest performer. Do the stay interview. Take notes on what really keeps them engaged. Find one way to give them more of that this month.



Part 2: Pick your most disengaged person. In your next 1:1, explore which performance killer dominates—emotional pressure (fear), economic pressure (just for money), or inertia (going through motions).



Don't try to motivate them harder. Instead, reduce the killer and add one driver.



Example: If they're driven by fear (emotional pressure), create safety and add purpose by showing how their work impacts real people.



Remember: Total Motivation isn't about pushing harder. It's about finding the right fuel.

**Coaching**

Coaching is a great tool to both empower your team, and reduce reliance on you.



Here is our Coaching template:



The Kickstart Question: What’s on Your Mind?

If you don’t know where to start. Start with the kickstart question. You’ll be surprised by what comes up in the answers.



You can ask the best follow up question, The AWE Question: “And What Else?”





The Focus Question: “What’s the Challenge Here for You?

So often when you’re talking to clients/colleagues/friends, they can go on and on with their issues/concerns. Here, this one question will zoom into the real issue.



“If you had to pick one of them to focus on which one would be the real challenge for you?”



TIP: Stick to “What” questions instead of “Why” questions because the latter puts them on the defensive.

“Why did you do that?” –> “What were you hoping for here?”

“Why did you think this was a good idea?” –> “What made you choose this course of action?”

“Why are you bothering with this?” –> “What’s important here for you?”



The Accountability question: "How are you contributing to this problem?"



This is the key moment in the conversation.



Here we move from coaching the problem, to coaching the person.



The Action Question: “Big move, Small move”

We want the player to call out what they are going to do.



Many times they will start with big moves, like "I need to build trust with team X", we ask them 'How' so they will decide on the specific action that needs to get done.







To continue with the trust example, we ask the player "How will you build trust?" 



They answer: "By creating a communication routine"



You: "What routine?"



They: "Customer red flags would be a good one"



You: "Sounds great, whom do you need to talk with to make that happen?"



And so it goes, until you have distilled a list of moves they can work on as soon as the meeting is over.



The Lazy Question: How Can I Help?

AKA: “What do you want from me?”

Notice how we ask this question after they declared what they are going to do, and not after!  



This way we give the team a sense of agency and control over their work and decisions.



The 70/30 Rule



They should talk 70% of the time. You talk 30%.



If you're talking more, you're teaching, not coaching. If you're solving their problem, you're consulting, not coaching.



Your job is to ask questions that help them think, not think for them.



Why Questions Don't Work



Never ask "Why?" It puts people on defense.



\- ❌ "Why did you do that?"



\- ✅ "What were you hoping for?"



\- ❌ "Why didn't you speak up?"



\- ✅ "What stopped you from speaking up?"



\- ❌ "Why is this important?"



\- ✅ "What makes this important to you?"



"What" questions create exploration. "Why" questions create justification.



The Advice Monster



You have an advice monster. We all do. It hears a problem and immediately wants to solve it.



The monster says:



\- "I know exactly what you should do"



\- "This reminds me of when I..."



\- "Have you tried..."



\- "What you need to do is..."



Your advice might even be good. That's not the point.



When you give advice, you rob them of learning. You keep them dependent. You become the bottleneck.



Coaching feels slower than telling. That's the point. You're building their brain, not just solving today's problem.







Try This Week



Next time someone comes with a problem, use the full framework:



1\. "What's on your mind?" (Let them download)



2\. "What's the real challenge here for you?" (Focus on one thing)



3\. "How are you contributing to this?" (Find their contribution)



5\. "Big Move\\ Small Move" (Get specific actions)



6\. "How can I help?" (After they own it)



Set a timer for 15 minutes. Don't give a single piece of advice. Just ask questions.



It will feel weird. You'll want to jump in with solutions. Don't.



Watch what happens when they solve their own problem. They'll leave energized instead of dependent. They'll execute better because it's their solution, not yours.



That's the paradox of coaching: By helping less, you help more.



**Feedback**



30% of feedback makes performance worse.



Not "doesn't help"—actively makes things worse.



That's from a meta-analysis of 607 studies on feedback effectiveness. Nearly one-third of the time, feedback decreases performance.



Why? Because most managers give garbage feedback like:



\- "Be more assertive"



\- "Show more initiative"



\- "Improve your communication"



\- "Be more strategic"



This isn't feedback. It's useless advice about personality change.



The Four-Step Formula



Real feedback follows this exact structure:



Step 1: The Action



What did they actually DO? Be specific enough that a camera could have recorded it.



Bad: "You're not responsive to clients"



Good: "Genesis emailed you Monday at 9am. You replied Wednesday at 4pm."



Step 2: The Outcome



What happened because of their action? This answers "why are we having this conversation?"



"Genesis is now threatening to cancel their contract. The CMO called me directly."



Step 3: Alternative Actions



Not what they should BE (personality) but what they should DO (behavior).



"Even if you don't have an answer, reply within 4 hours saying 'I got your email and will have an answer by \[specific time].'"



Step 4: Impact on Them



Show how the change helps THEM, not just you or the company.



"Quick responses build trust. Trusted people get the interesting projects and autonomy. You hate being micromanaged—this is how you prevent it."



A Complete Example



Action: "In yesterday's team meeting, when Sarah presented her idea, you immediately listed three reasons it wouldn't work."



Outcome: "Sarah stopped contributing. The team lost her perspective for the rest of the meeting."



Alternative: "Next time, ask 'What would need to be true for this to work?' before raising concerns."



Impact: "You want to be seen as strategic, not negative. Building on ideas before critiquing them shows strategic thinking."



The Personality Trap



Never give feedback about who someone IS. Only about what they DO.



Useless personality feedback:



\- "Be more confident"



\- "Show leadership"



\- "Be more strategic"



\- "Be less aggressive"



Useful behavioral feedback:



\- "Make eye contact with three people when presenting"



\- "Run the client meeting yourself instead of deferring to me"



\- "Connect your proposals to quarterly goals"



\- "Lower your voice and slow down when disagreeing"



People can't change who they are. They can change what they do.



The Timing Rule



Feedback has a half-life. Wait a week, lose 50% impact. Wait a month, might as well not bother.



But don't ambush. Schedule it:



"I want to discuss how the client meeting went. Can we talk this afternoon?"



This gives them time to prepare mentally and recall the situation.



The Preparation Requirement



Never give feedback spontaneously. Write it out first:



1\. What specific action? (Camera test)



2\. What measurable outcome? (Numbers, relationships, results)



3\. What alternative behavior? (Exact steps)



4\. What personal benefit? (For them, not you)



If you can't fill all four, you're not ready. You're about to give garbage feedback that makes things worse.



The Repeat Offender Protocol



First conversation: Focus on positive impact of changing



Second conversation: Include negative impact of not changing



Third conversation: This is now a performance issue, not feedback



If you're having the same feedback conversation three times, feedback isn't the tool you need.







Try This Week



Think of feedback you've been avoiding. Write it out:



1\. The exact behavior (what a camera would see)



2\. The business impact (specific, measurable)



3\. The alternative action (precisely what to do differently)



4\. Their personal win (how it helps them, not you)



If you can't connect the change to their personal benefit, question whether you're asking for the right change.



Then have the conversation within 48 hours. Use your notes. Don't wing it.



Say exactly what they did, exactly what happened, exactly what to do differently, and exactly how it helps them.



That specificity is the difference between feedback that changes behavior and feedback that just annoys people.



**1:1's**

Teresa Amabile from Harvard Business School wanted to know what really motivates people at work.



Not what they say motivates them in surveys. What actually motivates them day-to-day.



So, she did something brilliant: She had hundreds of workers from 7 companies keep daily journals. At the end of each day, they recorded their best and worst moments. She collected nearly 12,000 daily entries.



One factor dominated everything else: Progress on meaningful work.



Not recognition. Not incentives. Not relationships. Not perks.



Progress.



The days when people made progress on work that mattered to them were their best days. The days when they were blocked, stalled, or spinning were their worst.



Stack up progress days, you get engagement. Stack up blocked days, you get resignation letters.



The Progress Killer



Guess who's most likely to block your team's progress?



You.



Every delayed decision. Every "let me think about it." Every "wait for my approval." Every "let's discuss next week."



You're the bottleneck.



Your team is sitting idle, motivation draining, while they wait for you to unblock them. Meanwhile, you're in meetings talking about "engagement initiatives."



The 1:1 Framework That Creates Progress



Stop treating 1:1s as status updates. Make them progress accelerators.



1\. Top Priorities and Blockers (10 minutes)



"What are your 1-3 most important things this week?"



"What's blocking progress on any of them?"



"What do you need from me to unblock you RIGHT NOW?"



Not next week. Now. Either solve it in the meeting or commit to solving it within 24 hours.



2\. Calibrate Excellence (5 minutes)



"Show me what you're producing."



"Here's what excellence looks like."



"Here's the gap between them."



Most performance problems are clarity problems. They think they're doing great. You think they're missing the mark. Nobody's talking about it.



3\. Real-Time Feedback (5 minutes)



One thing they're doing well (specifically)



One thing to change (with clear alternative)



One thing you could do better for them



Don't save feedback for review time. Give it while it still matters.



4\. Zoom Out (10 minutes)



"How are you feeling overall?"



"What's giving you energy?"



"What's draining you?"



"What do you want to learn next?"



This isn't therapy. It's data gathering. You're looking for trends that predict turnover or breakthroughs.



The Progress Test



End every 1:1 with this question:



"What progress will you make before we meet again?"



If they can't answer clearly, you've wasted 30 minutes.



If they give the same answer week after week, something's blocking them that you're not addressing.



The Energy Audit



Once monthly, map their energy:



"What percentage of your time is on work that energizes you?"



"What percentage drains you?"



"What would need to change to improve that ratio?"



Then actually shift their mix. Even 10% more energizing work changes everything.



People don't quit jobs. They quit the daily experience of their job. When every day is draining, they leave. When most days have progress and energy, they stay.



The Calendar Reality



Look at next week's 1:1s. For each person, can you answer:



\- What are they trying to accomplish?



\- What's likely blocking them?



\- What decision do they need from me?



If you can't answer these, cancel the 1:1 and find out first. Walking in blind wastes everyone's time.







Try This Week



In your next 1:1:



1\. Start with: "What's your biggest blocker?"



2\. Solve it in the meeting or commit to solving within 24 hours



3\. End with: "What progress will this unlock?"



4\. Follow up in 48 hours: "Did you make the progress?"



Stop having conversations about work. Start removing barriers to work.



The best 1:1 isn't the one where you give great advice. It's the one where they leave able to make progress they couldn't make before.



Progress is the fuel. You control the throttle.



**Great Meetings**

What are you getting paid for?



To discuss? To review? To explore? To "align"?



No. You're paid to decide, define, agree, and commit.



Those are outcomes. Everything else is expensive theater.



Most meetings are where productivity goes to die. But yours don't have to be.



The 10 Behaviors That Create Great Meetings



Behavior #1: Start with the Outcome



Not: "Let's discuss the project"



But: "By meeting end, we will decide - launch Friday or delay two weeks"



If you can't state a specific outcome, cancel the meeting.



Behavior #2: Always Be Chairing (ABC)



You can't zone out. You can't check email. You can't let your mind wander.



The moment you stop actively directing, the meeting drifts into chaos. Tangents multiply. Rabbit holes open. Time evaporates.



Participatory meetings are anarchy. Someone must drive. That's you.



Behavior #3: Police Equal Participation



Six people, one hour = 10 minutes each.



\- One person dominating? Cut them off.



\- Three people silent? Call on them.



\- Two people arguing? Redirect to the group.



Intelligence of a group discussion equals the average speaking time equality. The more equal, the smarter the outcome.



Behavior #4: 50% Action, 50% Situation



Most meetings: 90% talking about problems, 10% solving them.



Set a timer. When half the meeting is gone, shift:



"We understand the situation. What are we going to DO?"



No going back to admire the problem more.



Behavior #5: Move Through Steps Deliberately



Every discussion follows this pattern:



1\. What's the situation?



2\. Is it good or bad?



3\. Why is it happening?



4\. What can we do?



Don't let people skip steps or jump backward. Move through each systematically.



"We're on step 3, understanding why. Let's finish that before we discuss solutions."



Behavior #6: Never Go Backward



Someone always tries: "But wait, are we sure this is even a problem?"



Unless they have new critical information: "We decided that. We're now on solutions."



Forward momentum only.



Behavior #7: Recap Every 10 Minutes



People's attention resets every 10 minutes. Use it:



"Here's where we are..."



"Here's what we've decided..."



"Here's what's next..."



This pulls wandering minds back and keeps everyone synchronized.



Behavior #8: The Cut-Off Protocol



When cutting someone off:



1\. Summarize what they said



2\. Acknowledge what it added



3\. Explain why you're moving on



4\. Park it if needed



5\. Redirect to the path



"Great point about budget impact, that's important context. Let's note it and come back after we decide on timeline. Now, what are our options for delivery?"



Behavior #9: Call Out Mode Switches



Conversations shift between:



\- Depth: One topic deeply



\- Breadth: Many topics briefly



Call it: "We're going deep on this one issue for 5 minutes. Then we'll open up to other topics."



When people know the mode, they adjust their contributions.



Behavior #10: End with Communication Brief



Last 5 minutes, always:



\- What did we decide?



\- Who needs to know?



\- Who tells them?



\- By when?



No exceptions. A decision nobody knows about didn't happen.



The Meeting Saboteurs



Remember that 1944 OSS manual? Watch for people who:



\- Give long philosophical speeches



\- Bring up last year's decisions



\- Debate word choices endlessly



\- Question already-made decisions



\- Worry about unlikely edge cases



\- Advocate "caution" constantly



Call them out: "That's interesting but not today's problem. Moving on."



Be polite but firm. Saboteurs rely on politeness to destroy productivity.



The Energy Drain



Bad meetings don't just waste time. They drain energy, kill morale, and teach people that nothing gets done.



Good meetings do the opposite. They create energy, build momentum, and teach people that decisions happen here.



Which are yours?







Try This Week



Run one meeting with all 10 behaviors:



Before the meeting:



\- Write the specific outcome you need



\- Identify who must be there (hint: fewer than you think)



During the meeting:



1\. State outcome upfront (1 minute)



2\. Stay actively in charge (constant)



3\. Track participation time (mental note)



4\. Force 50/50 situation/action split



5\. Move through steps deliberately



6\. Never go backward



7\. Recap every 10 minutes



8\. Cut people off productively



9\. Call out depth vs. breadth



10\. End with communication plan (5 minutes)



You'll feel like a dictator. Good. Meetings need dictators.



Democratic meetings are where productivity goes to die. Directed meetings are where decisions get made.



The best meeting isn't the one where everyone feels heard. It's the one that ends with clear decisions and assigned actions.



Stop having meetings. Start making decisions.
